                   as (informally) described in the Principia
                   Mathematica [32]. This formalization is close to the
                   ideas of the Principia, but also meets contemporary
                   requirements on formality and accuracy, and therefore
                   is a new supply to the known literature on the
                   Principia (like [25], [19], [6] and [7]).},

                   Recognition Software. Frank Plumpton Ramsey
                   (1903-1930) was a British mathematician who also made
                   significant and precocious contributions in
                   philosophy and economics before his death at the age
                   of 26. He was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein,
                   and was instrumental in translating Wittgenstein's
                   "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" into English, and in
                   persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and
                   to Cambridge. This volume collects Ramsey's most
                   important papers. Contents: The foundations of
                   mathematics.--Mathematical logic.--On a problem of
                   formal logic.--Universals.--Note on the preceding
                   paper.--Facts and propositions.--Truth and

  abstract =      {Since antiquity mathematicians have spoken of
                   classes, multitudes, and sets, but set theory as such
                   is a product of the 19th century (Bernard Bolzano,
                   Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, et al.). Not until
                   the 20th century did set theory attain an axiomatic
                   foundation (Ernst Zermelo, Thoralf Skolem, Johann von
                   Neumann, Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, et al.). In
                   this essay we discuss Zermelo's paper
                   ``Investigations in the foundations of set theory I''
                   (Investigations for short). In order fully to
                   appreciate Zermelo's research we must discuss the
                   19th century emergence of the concept of set as a
                   terminus technicus of mathematics as well as the
                   axiomatic method with all its many facets.},

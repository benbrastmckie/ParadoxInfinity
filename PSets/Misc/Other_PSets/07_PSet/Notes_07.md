
if automate 2019 borel set question, could do multiple drop-downs to avoid numerical value issue. could make 3 points each (i.e. 1.5 points for each sub-part: borel set yes/no and then the lebesgue measure if relevant)

could automate Cantor set question as well?: at least 8 points 

could also automate Andreas coin-toss question: at least 6 points [ideally I should change the values used?] 

note that i ought to review binary expansion stuff; matters for standard coin toss procedure. 

So part I could be 30+8+6 = 44 points

Part II: 16+40 = 56 points (sock question and back to bacon)

and seems totally reasonable since giving them two weeks for all this. probably an easier pset than many prior ones 

then would just need 7 10point hand-graded questions!

Sock question: at least 10 points (could increase to 16?)

Back to bacon (which I need to modify plausibly): 2019 parts (b), d, e, and f. so could easily have this be 40 points! 

so basically need 70-40-16 = 14 points! could do this w/ a hand-graded cantor problem for sure! or the coin toss problem that AD used last year 

alternatively, i could bail on the bacon problem and do the square of evil instead??? which wasn't even used last year! but i kinda want to talk about bacon puzzle in class during topic 7 anyways, doing yablo extension...

i could also discuss cantor set in class, illustrating how notion of lebesgue measure helps re-capture part of our intuitive notion of size of sets; returning to earlier course moral that viewing cardinality as `size' is in-apt in many contexts.

  <h1 id="section_hilbert">Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel</h1>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_hotel">The Hotel</h2>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">Hilbert</a>&rsquo;s Hotel is an infinite hotel: for each
      natural number 0, 1, 2, 3,… there is a room with that number. The hotel is completely full. Guest 0 is staying in
      room 0, Guest 1 is staying in room 1, and so forth.</p>

    <p>When a finite hotel is completely full, there is no way of accommodating additional guests (unless guests are
      willing to share rooms, which our guests are not). In an infinite hotel, however, the fact that the hotel is full
      is not an impediment to accommodating extra people.</p>

    <p>Say that Onyeka is a new guest. All the hotel manager needs to do to find her a room is make the following
      announcement: “Would guest \(n\) kindly relocate to room \(n+1\) ”. If all current guests abide by this request,
      Guest 0 will end up in room 1, Guest 1 will end up in room 2, and so forth. So even though all of the original
      guests still have a room of their own under the new arrangement, room 0 is available for Onyeka!</p>

    <p>It doesn&#8217;t stop there. Suppose 5 billion new guests arrive to our full hotel. We can accommodate them too!
      This time our announcement is this: “Would guest \(n\) kindly relocate to room \(n + 5 \text{ billion}\)”. In a
      similar way, we can accomodate any finite number of new guests!</p>

    <p>We can, in fact, even accommodate <em>infinitely</em> many new guests. If infinitely many guests arrive, we can
      tell each of the current guests “if you are in room \(n\), please relocate to room \(2n\) ”. That will leave every
      odd numbered room free for our infinitely many new guests to occupy.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_paradox">A Paradox</h2>

    <p>Consider the set of original guests, which we&rsquo;ll call “\(G\)”, and the set of original guests plus Onyeka,
      which we&rsquo;ll call “\(G^+\)". Here is an argument.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>\(G^+\) has everything \(G\) has in it, plus one more thing.</li>
      <li>Conclusion: \(G^+\) has more things in it than \(G\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That looks like a pretty good argument. Usually, if you have some apples, and somebody gives you an extra apple,
      you then have more apples. Seems like similar reasoning should work for hotel guests.</p>

    <p>Here is another argument.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>There are as many guests in \(G\) as hotel rooms in Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel.</li>
      <li>There are as many guests in \(G^+\) as hotel rooms in Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel.</li>
      <li>\(G^+\) has the same number of things in it as \(G\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That also looks like a pretty good argument. The first two premises definitely look right — there is one guest in
      \(G\) per hotel room, and there is also one guest in \(G^+\) per hotel room. And surely, the conclusion follows
      from those two premises, no?</p>

    <p>But if both these arguments work, then \(G^+\) both has more things in it than \(G\) and has the same number of
      things in it as \(G\). That can&rsquo;t be right! Paradox.</p>

  </ul>

  <h1 id="section_cardinality">Cardinality</h1>

  <p>For a long time, people thought that paradoxes like the one above showed that there was something wrong with trying
    to use notions like &ldquo;same number as&rdquo; or &ldquo;more than&rdquo; when we&rsquo;re talking about infinite
    sets. But then came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, 19th Century German
    mathematician, who had the essential insight, when it comes to infinity. He saw that there was a way of making
    precise notions like “more than”, “less than” and “same number as”; that, if you made these notions precise in this
    way, then paradoxes like the one above were resolved; and that these new, precise notions were extremely fruitful,
    mathematically.</p>

  <p>Let me explain.</p>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_bis">Bijections; Injections; Surjections</h2>

    <p>Here are the key notions. Suppose you have two sets: \(A\), the set of apples, and \(B\) the set of bananas.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is an <strong>injection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff you can pair every apple with a distinct banana
        (and possibly have some bananas left over).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>[More formally: a function \(f\) is an <strong>injection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff, for all \(a_1, a_2\in
      A\), if \(a_1\neq a_2\), then \(f(a_1)\neq(f(a_2)\) (and \(f(a_1), f(a_2)\in B\)).]</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is a <strong>surjection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff you can pair every apple with a banana, and not
        have any bananas left over (though maybe different apples get paired with the same banana).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>[More formally: a function \(f\) is a <strong>surjection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff, for all \(b\in B\),
      there exists an \(a\in A\) such that \(f\(a\)=b\).]</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There is a <strong>bijection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff you can pair every apple with a distinct banana,
        and not have any bananas left over — i.e., there is an injection from \(A\) to \(B\) that is also a surjection.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>[Slightly more formally: \(f\) is a <strong>bijection</strong> from \(A\) to \(B\) iff \(f\) is an injection from
      \(A\) to \(B\) and \(f\) is a surjection from \(A\) to \(B\).]</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_extending">Extending the Notion of Number</h2>

    <p>Cantor&rsquo;s insight, and what he helped prove, is that a perfectly coherent and extremely fruitful way of
      thinking of the notion of “same number as”, which works for both finite and infinite sets, is to just let “set
      \(A\) has the same number of members as set \(B\)” mean “there is a bijection from set \(A\) to set \(B\)”. </p>

    <p>Similarly, it is coherent and fruitful to let “the number of members of \(A\) is less than or equal to the number
      of member of \(B\)” mean “there is an injection from \(A\) to \(B\)”.</p>

    <p>That is a relatively obvious and simple insight, when it comes to finite sets. It accords with all the intuitive
      things you want to say about “same number as” and “less than or equal to”.</p>

    <p>But there is an important difference between finite sets and infinite sets. When we&rsquo;ve got a finite number
      of apples, and a finite number of bananas, and there is a bijection between the apples and the bananas, there
      isn&rsquo;t <em>also</em> a bijection from the apples to some proper sub-set of the bananas; it never happens that
      you can eat some of the bananas and <em>still</em> have the same number of apples as bananas.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s not so when we&rsquo;re talking about infinite sets. Take \(G\), the set of original guests at
      Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel, and \(G^+\), the set of original guests plus Onyeka. There is a bijection between \(G\) and
      a proper sub-set of \(G^+\) — it&rsquo;s just the identity function, which pairs guest 0 with herself, guest 1
      with himself, and so on. There is also a bijection between \(G\) and \(G^+\). You just pair Onyeka with guest 0,
      guest 0 with guest 1, guest 1 with guest 2,…</p>

    <p>So, in endorsing Cantor&rsquo;s sense of &ldquo;the same number as&rdquo;, we must reject the principle that a
      set \(A\) cannot have the same number of things in it as a set \(B\) that is in bijection with a proper subset of
      \(A\). That is, we reject the first of the two argument above:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>\(G^+\) has everything \(G\) has in it, plus one more thing.</li>
      <li>\(G^+\) has more things in it than \(G\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That is not a valid argument, using Cantor&rsquo;s sense of “more things”. On the other hand, this <em>is</em> a
      valid argument:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>There are as many guests in \(G\) as hotel rooms in Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel.</li>
      <li>There are as many guests in \(G^+\) as hotel rooms in Hilbert&rsquo;s Hotel.</li>
      <li>\(G^+\) has the same number of things in it as \(G\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To be clear that we are talking about a more precise, and less intuitive, notion than the ordinary one, instead
      of talking about the “number of members” of a set, we will talk about the <em>cardinality</em> of a set. </p>

    <p>By definition, </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>the <strong>cardinality</strong> of a set \(A\) equals the cardinality of a set \(B\) iff there is a bijection
        from \(A\) to \(B\). </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Similarly, by definition</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>the <strong>cardinality</strong> of \(A\) is less than or equal to the cardinality of \(B\) iff there is an
        injection from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here is some new notation: “\(|A|\)” means “the cardinality of \(A\)”. We can put the above definitions as
      follows: \[|A|=|B| \text{ iff there is a bijection from }A\text{ to }B\]
      and
      \[|A|\le|B| \text{ iff there is an injection from }A\text{ to }B\]</p>

    <p>These are the two most basic definitions in the theory of cardinalities. Everything else is defined in terms of
      these. So, for instance, \(|A|&lt;|B|\) is defined as \(|A|\le|B|\) and \(|A|\neq|B|\). And \(|A|\ge|B|\) is
      defined as \(|B|\le|A|\).</p>

    <p>This is all equivalent to the normal, intuitive sense of &ldquo;number&rdquo;, when we are talking about finite
      sets; it extends that intuitive notion into the unfamiliar territory of infinite sets.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_bijections">Some Properties of Bijections</h2>

    <p>Here are some things that are handy to know about bijections.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Bijections are <strong>reflexive</strong>. That is: there is a bijection from every set \(A\) to itself. For
          example, the identity function \(f(a)=a\), for all \(a\in A\).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bijections are <strong>symmetric</strong>. That is: if there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\), there is a
          bijection from \(B\) to \(A\). (In particular, if \(f\) is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\), \(f^{-1}\) is a
          bijection from \(B\) to \(A\). Convince yourself!)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Because of this fact, we often say there is a bijection <em>between</em> \(A\) and \(B\), rather than saying
      there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\).</p>

    <ol start="3">
      <li>Bijections are <strong>transitive</strong>. That is: if there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\), and a
        bijection from \(B\) to \(C\), there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(C\). (In particular, if \(f\) is a bijection
        from \(A\) to \(B\), and \(g\) is a bijection from \(B\) to \(C\), then \(g\circ f\) is a bijection from \(A\)
        to \(C\). Convince yourself!)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Because bijections have these three properties, the definition we gave above of when two sets have the same
      cardinality is a good definition, and “=&rdquo; is an appropriate symbol to use.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_injections">Some Properties of Injections</h2>

    <p>Here are some handy things to know about injections, and hence about the “less than or equal to” relation among
      cardinalities.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Injections are <strong>reflexive</strong> (just like bijections, above).</li>
      <li>Injections are <strong>transitive</strong> (just like bijections, above).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is the really interesting one:</p>

    <ol start="3">
      <li>Injections are <strong>anti-symmetric</strong>. That is: if there is an injection from \(A\) to \(B\), and an
        injection from \(B\) to \(A\), then there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(B\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In other words: if \(|A|\le |B|\), and (\|B|\le |A|\), then \(|A|=|B|\)</p>

    <p>Properties (1) and (2) are pretty easy to prove. (Give it a go!) Property (3) is <em>not</em> trivial; it is most
      commonly called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem">the
        Schröder-Bernestein Theorem</a>”, though it was first proved by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a>. (Dedekind seems to have had a habit
      of proving things and not telling anyone about it, which is why his name doesn&rsquo;t appear everywhere it
      should.)</p>

    <p>These three facts together mean that \(\le\), as defined for cardinalities, is a <strong>partial order</strong>,
      in just the way that you would expect a property that uses “\(le\)” as its symbol to be.</p>

    <p>For \(\le\) to be a <strong>total order</strong> (also called a “linear order”), the following also needs to be
      true:</p>

    <ol start="4">
      <li>Injections are <strong>total</strong>. That is: for all sets \(A\) and \(B\), either there is an injection
        from \(A\) to \(B\) or there is an injection from \(B\) to \(A\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>To prove this, you need to use the Axiom of Choice. That is an axiom of set theory which is usually assumed,
      these days, though it remains the most controversial axiom of standard set theory. We will have more to say about
      the Axiom of Choice later in this course.</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_example">An Example</h2>

    <p>Here are two sets that have the same cardinality: \(\mathbb{N}\), the set of natural numbers, and \(\mathbb{Z}\),
      the set of integers.</p>

    <p>Proof: let \(f(n)\) be the function such that
    <ul>
      <li>if \(n\) is an even natural number, \(f(n)=\frac{n}{2}\), and</li>
      <li>if \(n\) is an odd natural number, \(f(n)=-\frac{n+1}{2}\)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Thus:

    <p>Claim: \(f(n)\) is a bijection from the naturals to the integers.</p>

    <p>In order to verify that \(f\) is a bijection from the natural numbers to the integers, we need to verify that
      \(f\) is a function from the natural numbers to the integers, that is is an injection, and that it is a
      surjection.</p>

    <p>We know that \(f\) is a function from the natural numbers to the integers because whenever \(n\) is a natural
      number, \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(-\frac{n+1}{2}\) are both integers.</p>

    <p>We know that \(f\) is injective because, whenever \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are natural numbers we have the following:
      (a) the only way for it to be the case that \(\frac{n_1}{2} = \frac{n_2}{2}\) is for it to be the case that
      \(n_1=n_2\), and (b) the only way for it to be the case that \(-\frac{n_1+1}{2} = -\frac{n_2+1}{2}\) is for it to
      be the case that \(n_1=n_2\).</p>

    <p>We know that \(f\) is surjective because: (a) each non-negative integer is of the form \(\frac{n}{2}\) for some
      even natural number \(n\), and (b) each negative integer is of the form \(-\frac{n+1}{2}\) for some odd natural
      number \(n\).</p>

    <p>End of proof.</p>

    <p>Also the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{N}\): the even natural numbers. Also: the multiples of 7. Exercise: prove
      this.</p>

  </ul>

  <h1 id="section_rational">The Rational Numbers</h1>

  <p>A rational number is a number equal to \(\frac{a}{b}\), where \(a\) is an integer, and \(b\) is an integer distinct
    from zero. (For instance, \(\frac{17}{3}\) is a rational number, and so is \(4=\frac{4}{1}\).)</p>

  <p>Here is a surprising fact: the cardinality of the set of rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) is the <em>same</em> as
    the cardinality of the set of natural numbers.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to see this is by building a matrix, such as the following:</p>
  <center><img src="http://web.mit.edu/arayo/www/Paradox/rationals-unmarked.gif" type="saveimage"
      target="[object Object]"
      alt="A grid. The top row reads '0/1, 0/2, 0/3,&hellip;' The second row reads '1/1, 1/2, 1/3,&hellip;'. And so on."

  <p>Every (non-negative) rational number appears on some cell of our matrix. So we can show that there is a bijection
    between the natural numbers and the (non-negative) rational numbers by assigning a different natural number to each
    cell. </p>

  <p>There are many different ways of doing this. One is to follow the route below:</p>

  <center><img src="http://web.mit.edu/arayo/www/Paradox/diagonal.gif" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]"
      alt="The same grid as above, with a path drawn over it. The path starts at the top left square of the grid, with the '0/1'. It then goes down to the second row, first colum, with the '1/1'. It then goes diagonally up to the '0/2'. Then across to the '0/3'. Then diagonally down, through '1/2' to '2/1'. Then it goes down to '3/1', then diagonally up through '2/2', 1/3' to '0/4'. And so on, zigzagging through every square of the grid."
      height="400" width="400" /></center>

  <p>As you advance through the red path, you assign natural numbers to (non-negative) rational numbers:
    \[0 \rightarrow \frac{0}{1}\]
    \[1 \rightarrow \frac{1}{1}\]
    \[2 \rightarrow \frac{0}{2}\]
    \[3 \rightarrow \frac{0}{3}\]
    \[4 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\]
    \[\vdots\]
  </p>

  <p>Actually, a slight adjustment is needed to correct for the fact that rational numbers appear on the matrix multiple
    times under different names (\(0\), for example, appears as &ldquo;\(\frac{0}{1}\)&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;\(frac{0}{2}&rdquo;, &ldquo;\frac{0}{3}&rdquo;, etc.). We can address the issue by following the same route,
    but skipping any cells with rational numbers that have already been counted. So the assignment we get is actually
    the following:
    \[0 \rightarrow \frac{0}{1} = 0\]
    \[1 \rightarrow \frac{1}{1} = 1\]
    \[2 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\]
    \[3 \rightarrow \frac{2}{1} = 2\]
    \[4 \rightarrow \frac{3}{1} = 3\]
    \[\vdots\]
  </p>

  <p>This assignment immediately yields a bijection \(f\) from the natural numbers to the (non-negative) rational
    numbers:
    \[f(0) = 0\]
    \[f(1) = 1\]
    \[f(2) =1/2\]
    \[f(3) = 2\]
    \[f(4) = 3\]
    \[\vdots\]
  </p>

  <p>This construction gives you a bijection from the naturals to the non-negative rationals. Exercise: show that there
    is a bijection from the naturals to the rationals (i.e., the set of both negative and non-negative rationals).</p>

  <h1 id="section_real">The Real Numbers</h1>

  <p>Lots of infinite sets have the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Do all infinite sets have the same
    cardinality as the natural numbers? No! The first result to this effect was proved by Cantor, and it is the result
    that started the whole field of study of trans-finite cardinalities (as they are called).</p>

  <p>The result is that the cardinality of the real numbers is larger than the cardinality of the natural numbers.</p>

  <p>Let&rsquo;s prove it!</p>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_n01">Step 1: The Cardinality of the Naturals is Less Than or Equal to the Cardinality of [0,1]</h2>

    <p>This part is pretty easy. Consider the function \(f=\frac{1}{n+1}\). Claim: that is a an injection from
      \(\mathbb{N}\) to \([0,1]\). That should be pretty easy to convince yourself of; just note that if \(n_1 \neq
      n_2\), then \(\frac{1}{n_1+1}\neq \frac{1}{n_2+1}\).</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_n01">Step 2: The Cardinality of the Naturals is Not Equal to the Cardinality of [0,1]</h2>

    <p>This is the ingenious part. The proof is by <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>; that is, we assume something, show
      that it leads to contradiction, and conclude the negation of the thing that we assumed. In this case, we assume
      that \(|\mathbb{N}| = |[0,1]|\), derive a contradiction, and conclude that \(|\mathbb{N}|\neq |[0,1]|\).</p>

    <p>So: suppose that \(|\mathbb{N}| = |[0,1]|\). Then there is a bijection \(f\) from \(\mathbb{N}\) to ([0,1]). If
      \(f\) exists, it can be used to make a list of all real numbers between 0 and 1:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The first member of our list is \(f(0)\), which will be some particular real number ; say,
        \(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots\) (where \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\),… are digits between &ldquo;0&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;9&rdquo;).</li>
      <li>The second member of our list is \(f(1)\), which is again some particular real number; say,
        \(0.b_1b_2b_3\ldots\) (where \(b_1\), \(b_2\), \(b_3\),… are digits between &ldquo;0&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;9&rdquo;).</li>
      <li>The third member of our list is \(f(2)\), which is again some particular real number; say,
        \(0.c_1c_2c_3\ldots\) (where \(c_1\), \(c_2\), \(c_3\),… are digits between &ldquo;0&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;9&rdquo;).</li>
      <li>And so forth.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We can represent it using this table, with the \(n\)th row representing \(f(n)\).
      <center><img src="http://web.mit.edu/arayo/www/Paradox/reals-plain.gif" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]"
          alt="A grid. The top row reads '0.', then 'a1, a2, a3, ...' The second row reads '0.' then 'b1, b2, b3, ...'. And so on."
          height="400" width="400" /></center>
    </p>

    <p>Now consider the digits on the table that have been marked in red. (Don&rsquo;t forget that the diagonal is
      supposed to go infinitely far&#8230;)

      <center><img src="http://web.mit.edu/arayo/www/Paradox/reals-colored.gif" type="saveimage"
          target="[object Object]"
          alt="The same grid as above, with a diagonal series of cells highlighted. The highlted cells read 'a1, b2, c3, d4, ...'."
          height="400" width="400" /></center>
    </p>

    <p>We can use these digits to build the &ldquo;diagonal&rdquo; real number \(D\) , as follows:
      \[D=0.a_1b_2c_3d_4e_5\ldots\]</p>

    <p>(Because each of \(a_1,b_2,c_3,d_4,e_5,\ldots\) is a digit between &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;9&rdquo;, \(D\)
      must be a real number between 0 and 1.)</p>

    <p>The thing about \(D\) is that it has an evil twin: the number \(D^*\).</p>

    <p>\(D^*\) is simply the result of applying the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; function \(e\) to each of the digits in \(D\):
      \[D^*=0.e(a_1)e(b_2)e(c_3)e(d_4)e(e_5)\ldots\]where \[e(x)=7\text{ if }x\neq7\]
      \[e(x)=3\text{ if }x=7\]</p>
    <p>Suppose, for instance, that our list of reals were to be filled out as follows:
      <center><img src="http://web.mit.edu/arayo/www/Paradox/reals-numbered.gif" type="saveimage"
          target="[object Object]"
          alt="A similar grid to the one above, except all the letters have been replaced by arbitrary numbers. The numbers in the highlighted diagonal cells read  '7, 3, 1, 7, ...'"
          height="400" width="400" /></center>
      Then \(D = 0.7317\ldots\), and \(D^* = 0.3773\ldots\).
    </p>

    <p>Like \(D\), \(D^\star\) is simply a real number between 0 and 1. What is interesting about \(D^\star\) is that we
      have a way of showing that it must be different from each of the real numbers that make up the rows of our table.
      It must be different from the number on the first row because that number has \(a_1\) as its first digit and
      \(D^\star\) has \(e(a_1)\) (which is different from \(a_1\)); it must be different from the number on the second
      row because that number has \(b_2\) as its second digit and \(D^*\) has \(e(b_2)\) (which is different from
      \(b_2\)); and so forth, for every row of our table.</p>

    <p>(In our example, you can tell that \(D^*\) is different from the number on the first row of the table because
      that number has &ldquo;7&rdquo; as its first digit and \(D^*\) has &ldquo;3&rdquo;; you can tell that \(D^*\) is
      different from the number on the second row because that number has &ldquo;3&rdquo; as its second digit and
      \(D^*\) has &ldquo;7&rdquo;; and so forth.)</p>

    <p>So we know that \(D^*\) is a real number between 0 and 1 which is not on our table. But that contradicts the
      assumption we made earlier: that our table includes every real number between 0 and 1. So \(|\mathbb{N}| =
      |[0,1]|\) cannot be true, after all. So not-(\(|\mathbb{N}| = |[0,1]|/)) must be true, which is what we wanted to
      prove.</p>


    <ul>
      <h3 id="section_complication">A Small Complication</h3>

      <p>There is a small worry you might have, that has to do with the fact that we are dealing with <em>names</em> of
        real numbers, rather than real numbers, in the above proof.</p>

      <p>Some real numbers have <em>two</em> names in decimal notation; for instance, \(\frac{1}{2}\), which has the
        names “0.4999&hellip;”, and “0.5000&hellip;&rdquo; in decimal notation.</p>

      <p>So, you might worry, the fact that a certain <em>name</em> of a real number isn&rsquo;t on our list —
        that&rsquo;s what the diagonal argument shows — doesn&rsquo;t mean that that number isn&rsquo;t on our list
        somewhere, under a different name.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, this is not a big problem for our proof. The only real numbers that have two names in decimal
        notation are numbers with a name that ends in all &ldquo;0&rdquo;s, and a name that ends in all
        &ldquo;9&rdquo;s. And the formula given above for finding the evil number finds a number with a name that has
        neither &ldquo;0&rdquo;s nor &ldquo;9&rdquo;s in it. So that number has only one name in decimal notation. So if
        that name isn&rdquo;t on the list, that number is not represented under <em>any</em> name on the list.</p>

    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>From step 1 and step 2, we can conclude that the cardinality of the naturals is less than the cardinality of [0,1].
    Amazing!</p>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_01r">Step 3: The Cardinality of [0,1] Equals the Cardinality of the Reals</h2>

    <p>To show this, we need to show that there is a bijection from \([0,1]\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) (i.e., the set of real
      numbers). That is actually a bit trickier than you might think. Here&rsquo;s a way to do it.</p>

    <ul>

      <h3 id="section_open01r">Step 3a: The Cardinality of (0,1) Equals the Cardinality of the Reals</h3>

      <ul>

        <h4 id="section_tan">Step 3a-i: The Cardinality of (-&pi;/2, &pi;/2) Equals the Cardinality of the Reals</h4>

        <p>Consider \(f(x)=\text{tan}(x)\). That is a bijection from \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\) to
          \(\mathbb{R}\). The easiest way to see this is to look at the graph of \(\text{tan}(x)\). Convince yourself!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4 id="section_linear">Step 3a-ii: The Cardinality of (0,1) Equals the Cardinality of (-&pi;/2, &pi;/2)</h4>

        <p>Consider \(f(x) = \pi(x - \frac{1}{2})\). That&rsquo;s a bijection from \((0,1)\) to \((-\pi/2,\pi/2)\).
          Convince yourself!</p>
      </ul>

      <p>From steps 3a-i and 3a-ii we can conclude that the cardinality of \((0,1)\) equals the cardinality of
        \(\mathbb{R}\); we are using the transitivity of bijections to conclude this.</p>

      <p>We can, in fact, state explicitly one such bijection; it is \(\text{tan}\circ f\), where \(f\) is the function
        mentioned in step 3a-ii.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 id="section_openclose">Step 3b: The Cardinality of [0,1] Equals the Cardinality of (0,1)</h3>

      <p>This is the trickiest part of Step 3. Here&rsquo;s how to do it.</p>

      <p>We define a bijection from \([0,1]\) to \((0,1)\).Take some subset of \([0,1]\) with the cardinality of the
        natural numbers — say, the set of all numbers \(\frac{1}{n+1}\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). Call that set \(S\).
      </p>

      <p>Let every number in \([0,1]\) be mapped to itself except for \(0\), \(1\), and the members of \(S\). </p>

      <p>Let \(0\) be mapped to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Let \(1\) be mapped to \(\frac{1}{3}\). </p>

      <p>Let each \(frac{1}{n+1}\in S\) be mapped to \(frac{1}{n+3}\).</p>

      <p>In summary: \(f\) is the function from \([0,1]\) to \((0,1)\) such that: \[f(0)=\frac{1}{2}\]
        \[f(1)=\frac{1}{3}\] \[\text{for all }\frac{1}{n+1}\in S\text{, }f(\frac{1}{n+1})=\frac{1}{n+3}\text{, and }\]
        \[f(x)=x\text{ otherwise.}\]</p>

      <p>\(f\) is a bijection. (Convince yourself this is so!)</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Putting this all together, we get: \(|[0,1]|=|\mathbb{R}|\). Success!</p>

  </ul>

  <p>Putting <em>that</em> together with step 2, we get: \(|\mathbb{N}|\le|\mathbb{R}|\). Double success!</p>

  <p>Putting <em>that</em> together with step 1, we get \(|\mathbb{N}|&lt;|\mathbb{R}|\). Hooray!</p>

  <br>

  <h1 id="section_helpful">A Helpful Result</h1>

  <p>The technique we used in the last part of Step 3, above, can be generalised to a useful result.</p>

  <p>A set \(C\) is <strong>countable</strong> iff \(|C|\le |\mathbb{N}|\). Here is the result.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>If \(|A|\ge|\mathbb{N}|\), then, for any countable \(C\), \(|A\cup C|=|A|\).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Here is the proof:</p>

  <p>Take a subset of \(A\) with the cardinality of \(\mathbb{N}\).<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1"
        title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Call that subset &ldquo;\(A^\mathbb{N}\)&rdquo;, and call its
    elements &ldquo;\(a_0, a_1, a_2,\ldots\)&rdquo;. First we show that </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Lemma: \(|A^\mathbb{N}\cup C| = |A^\mathbb{N}|\) (and, hence, equals \(|\mathbb{N}|\)).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>How&rsquo;s that? Take all elements of \(C\) that aren&rsquo;t also in \(A^\mathbb{N}\) — call the set of them
    “\(C^-\)”. At most, \(|C^-|=|\mathbb{N}|\). Suppose it does. Call the elements of \(C^-\) &ldquo;\(c_0, c_1,
    c_2,\ldots\)&rdquo; </p>

  <p>Let \(f\) be the function that maps \(a_0, a_1, a_2,\ldots \in A^\mathbb{N}\cup C\) to \(a_0, a_2, a_4,\ldots\in
    A^\mathbb{N}\), and maps \(c_0, c_1, c_2,\ldots\in A^\mathbb{N}\cup C\) to \(a_1, a_3, a_5,\ldots\in A^\mathbb{N}\).
  </p>

  <p>\(f\) is a bijection from \(A^\mathbb{N}\cup C\) to \(A^\mathbb{N}\). (Convince yourself that this is so!)</p>

  <p>If \(|C|&lt;|\mathbb{N}\), then it is even easier to show that there is a bijection from \(A^\mathbb{N}\cup C\) to
    \(A^\mathbb{N}\). I leave this as a fun diversion for the reader.</p>

  <p>Now, here&rsquo;s a bijection from \(A\cup C\) to \(A\). Map everything in \(A\cup C\) to itself except for the
    members of \(A^\mathbb{N}\cup C\). Map those elements to \(A\mathbb{N}\), via \(f\).</p>

  <p>And so: \(|A^\mathbb{N}\cup C|=|A|\)</p>

  <br>

  <h1 id="section_vector">R, R<sup>2</sup>, …</h1>

  <p>So the cardinality of the reals is greater than the cardinality of the naturals. And you can see, from the proof,
    that any interval of real numbers has the same cardinality as the set of all the reals, and hence a greater
    cardinality than the naturals. Crazy!</p>

  <p>What about \(\mathbb{R^{2}}\) — that is, the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers? That too has the cardinality
    of the real numbers! Here is a proof.</p>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_01dto01d2">Step 1: |[0,1]<sup>d</sup>|=|[0,1]<sup>d</sup> &times; [0,1]<sup>d</sup>|</h2>

    <p>Let \([0,1]^d\) be the set of all names of real numbers between 0 and 1 in decimal notation. We prove that that
      set has the same cardinality as \([0,1]^d\times [0,1]^d\) — i.e., the set of all ordered pairs of names of real
      numbers between 0 and 1.</p>

    <p>The following is a bijection: \[ f(0.a_1a_2a_3a_4\ldots) = \langle
      0.a_1a_3a_5a_7\ldots,0.a_2a_4a_6a_8\ldots\rangle ]</p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section_01to01d">Step 2: (|0,1| = |0,1<sup>d</sup>|)</h2>

    <p>Let \(D\) be the set of real numbers in \([0,1]\) with duplicate decimal expansions, and let \(D^d\) be all names
      in decimal notation of numbers in \(D\).</p>

    <p>The crucial observation is that there are two names in \(D^d\) for each member of \(D\), one of which ends in
      zeroes, the other in nines. Since only a rational number can have a decimal expansion ending in all zeroes, or
      ending in all nines, this means that every number in \(D\) is a rational number, and therefore that \(D\) is
      countable. For each number in \(D\), \(D^d\) contains two names, and is thus also countable.</p>

    <p>Let \([0,1]^0\) be the result of removing from \([0,1]^d\) every expansion ending in all nines. Since there are
      no longer any duplicate expansions in \([0,1]^0\), and since every member of \([0,1]\) still has an expansion in
      \([0,1]^0\), we know that \[|[0,1]^0| = |[0,1]|\].</p>

    <p>Now, \(|[0,1]^0|\ge \mathbb{N}\) (there is an injection from \(\mathbb{N})\) to \(|[0,1]^0\) via
      \(f=\frac{1}{n+1}\) and via the function from a real number a name for that number in decimal notation.) And
      \(D^d\) is countable. So, by the handy result above, \(|[0,1]^0| = |[0,1]^0\cup D^d|\). And \([0,1]^0\cup D^d\)
      just is \([0,1]^d\). So \[|[0,1]^0| = |[0,1]^d|\] From which it follows that \[|[0,1]|=|[0,1]^d|\].</p>

    <p>As a corollary, \(|[0,1] \times [0,1]| = |[0,1]^d \times [0,1]^d|\).</p>

  </ul>

  <p>Putting steps 1 and 2 together, we get \[|[0,1]|=|[0,1]\times [0,1]\]</p>

  <p>We already know that \(|\mathbb{R}|=|[0,1]|\), and, hence, that \(|[0,1]\times [0,1]| = |\mathbb{R}\times
    \mathbb{R}|\). So, from above, we get \[|\mathbb{R}|=|\mathbb{R}^2|\]</p>

  <p>We can go further. A similar construction to the one above shows that \(|[0,1]| = |[0,1]\times [0,1] \times
    [0,1]|\), and another shows that \(|[0,1]| = |[0,1]\times [0,1] \times [0,1]|\times [0,1]\), and so on, and, hence
    that, for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), \[|\mathbb{R}|=|\mathbb{R}^n|\]</p>

  <p>And, in fact, \[|\mathbb{R}|=|\mathbb{R}^\mathbb{N}|\] (though you can&rsquo;t prove it using the method above).
  </p>

  <p>Whoa!</p>

  <br>

  <h1 id="section_cantor">Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem</h1>

  <p>So now we have two infinite cardinalities: the cardinality of the natural numbers, and the cardinality of the real
    numbers. And we&rsquo;ve seen that it is not easy to find a set any bigger than the reals. Is that it? Have we got
    as big as it gets?</p>

  <p>No. We haven&rsquo;t. And Cantor showed that we can <em>never</em> get as big as it gets. For every set, there is a
    bigger set. There are infinite number of infinite cardinalities!</p>

  <p>The result I will now prove is called <strong>Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem</strong>. It says, to put it roughly, that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A set always has more subsets than it has members.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To put it more formally: a <strong>power set</strong> \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is the set of all subsets of \(A\).<sup><a
        href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Cantor theorem states that
    \[|\mathcal{P}(A)|&gt;|A|\]</p>

  <ul>

    <h2 id="section_proof">The Proof</h2>

    <p>We have to prove that</p>

    <ol>
      <li>\(|A| \leq |\mathcal{P}(A)|\), and</li>
      <li>\(|A| \neq |\mathcal{P}(A)|\)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first of these is relatively easy to prove, since the function \(f(x) = \{x\}\) is an injection from \(A\) to
      \(\mathcal{P}(A)\). So what we really need to prove is the second statement: \(|A| \neq |\mathcal{P}(A)|\).</p>

    <p>Our proof will proceed by <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>. So we will assume the negation of \(|A| \neq
      |\mathcal{P}(A)|\): \[|A| = |\mathcal{P}(A)|\] and use this assumption to prove a contradiction.</p>

    <p>In order for our assumption to be true, there must be a bijection \(f\) from \(A\) to \(\mathcal{P}(A)
      \). </p>

    <p>Notice that, for each \(a\) in \(A\), we can ask the following question:</p>

    <p>\[a \in f(a)\text{?}\]</p>

    <p>(If, for example, \(f\) maps \(a\) to \(\{\}\), then not-(\(a \in f(a)\)). If, on the other hand, \(f\) maps
      \(a\) to \(\{a\}\), then \(a \in f(a)\).)</p>

    <p>With this in mind, let us define \(D\) to be the subset of \(A\) such that</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>for any \(x\), \(x \in D\) if and only if not-(\(x \in f(x)\))</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We now note the following two things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>\(D\) is a subset of \(A\), and therefore \(D \in \mathcal{P}(A)\).</li>
      <li>\(f\), being a bijection, is a surjection from \(A\) to \(\mathcal{P}(A)\).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>From these two things together it follows that there must be some \(d \in A\) such that \(f(d) = D\).</p>

    <p>Question: \(d \in D\)?</p>

    <p>By the definition of \(D\), \(d \in D\) if and only if not-(\(d \in f(d)\)).</p>

    <p>Since \(f(d) = D\), this can be restated as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>\(d \in D\) if and only if not-(\(d \in D\)).</p>

    <p>But that is impossible! It says that something is the case if and only if it is not the case.</p>

    <p>We have arrived at our contradiction. So our assumption must be false. In other words: it cannot be the case that
      \(|A| = |\mathcal{P}(A)|\).</p>

    <p>So we have shown that \(|A| &lt; |\mathcal{P}(A)|\). We have shown that, regardless of how many things there are
      in \(A\), there must be more in \(\mathcal{P}(A)). Amazing!</p>

          <p>We know there must be such a subset, as (|S|&gt;|\mathbb{N}|), so there is an injection from (\mathbb{N})
            to (|S|); we can just let the countable subset be the range of this injection. In general, for similar
            reasons, whenever (|A|\le|B|), there is a subset of \(A\) with the cardinality of \(B\). <a href="#fnref:1"

          <p>For example: if \(A\) is the set \(\{0,1,2\}\), then \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is \(\{\{\}, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\},

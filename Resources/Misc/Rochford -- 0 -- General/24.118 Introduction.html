<h1 id="section_course">What is this Course About?</h1>

<p>This course is an exploration of a cluster of inter-related puzzles and intellectual wonders, including paradoxes of time-travel, different sizes of infinity, the nature of probability and Gödel’s Theorem. Understanding any one of the topics we’ll talk about will help with understanding the rest, but the main thing that unites the topics of this course is that philosophers find them cool. I hope you will too!</p>

<p>Actually, that’s not quite right — what unites these topics is that they are cool, and that they are amenable to technical treatment. This course is, in effect, an introductory survey of some of the highlights of more technical philosophy.</p>

<p>You might be surprised to learn there <em>is</em> such a thing as technical philosophy. But, I assure you, there is. Why? Well, philosophy is all about trying to extend the boundaries of rigorous theorising. Technical stuff can help us with this project in two ways. Firstly, it can help get use out to that edge — there’s stuff out there you wouldn’t even be able to conceive of without the help of technical tools. Secondly; when you’re out at the edge of theorising, it can be difficult to tell whether you are talking sense or nonsense. Technical stuff is a way of trying to impose some discipline on our theorising, to help from falling off the edge into crazy land. It is not always the best way, it is not a guarantee that what you are saying really makes sense, but it can help, and sometimes it is very fruitful.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time on the intellectual frontier, this course is for you.</p>

<h1 id="section_paradox">Paradox?</h1>

<p>Our way in to a topic is often going to be via a <em>paradox</em>. What’s that? It’s a kind of <em>argument</em>. </p>

<ul>
<h2 id="section_argument">Argument?</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever taken a philosophy course at MIT before, then you have no doubt seen something like following definition of an argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An <strong>argument</strong> is an ordered sequence of (declarative) sentences, the last of which is the <strong>conclusion</strong>, the rest of which are the <strong>premises</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should think of the argument as an attempt to give you a reason to believe the conclusion.</p>

<p>There are two good properties an argument can have. The first is that it’s premises are <strong>true</strong>. The second is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Validity</strong>: an argument is valid iff it is <em>impossible</em> that (the premises are true and the conclusion is false).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is our way of making precise the idea that the conclusion <em>follows</em> from the premises.</p>

<p>Just to help you get the idea, here are some examples of valid arguments:</p>

<br>

<ol>
<li><p>If Momoko brought cheese, we have too much cheese.</p></li>
<li><p>Momoko brought cheese.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, we have too much cheese.</p></li>
</ol>

<br>

<ol>
<li><p>If Said is in his office, the light is on.</p></li>
<li><p>The light is not on.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, Said is not in his office.</p></li>
</ol>

<br>

<ol>
<li><p>You’re either crazy or a genius.</p></li>
<li><p>You’re not crazy.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, you’re genius.</p></li>
</ol>

<br>

<p>If an argument has true premises, and it’s valid, then the conclusion of the argument <em>has</em> to be true. (Some terminology: valid argument with true premises are <strong>sound</strong> arguments.) So if you’re convinced that the premises of an argument are true, and that the argument is valid, then you <em>have</em> to accept the conclusion.</p>

<p>So when you are confronted with an argument, you have three choices.
1. Reject a premise.
2. Claim that the argument is invalid.
3. Accept the conclusion.</p>

<h2 id="section_paradoxes">Paradoxes</h2>

<p>A <strong>paradox</strong> is an argument where you don’t want to take any of the above three options — they all seem bad. The premises seem like they’ve got to be true, the argument seems like it’s valid, but the conclusion seems like it’s got to be false.</p>

<p>That’s a pickle! We know there’s got to be a problem somewhere — it can’t be that the premises are true, the argument is valid, and the conclusion is false. The challenge of a paradox is to find the problem.</p>

<p>I’ll give you some warm-up examples later in class.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="section_infinity">Infinity</h1>

<p>We’ll be talking about infinity in this class for three reasons;
1. It is inherently interesting
2. It will be really helpful for understanding some of the other things we want to talk about, and
3. It is a great example of a paradox with a success story.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate on this third reason a little. Paradoxes are often quite baffling, and it can be easy to lose faith that there is much progress or insight to be made by trying to tackle them. That certainly seemed to be the case when it came to paradoxes of infinity, for most of human history. All sorts of crazy things seems to follow, once you start thinking about infinity, including outright contradictions, and for a long time people thought this showed that the very idea of infinity didn’t really make sense.</p>

<p>But, we now have a beautiful, rigorous and highly fruitful theory of infinity. It doesn’t make all the weird things that happen, when you start thinking about infinity, go away, but it dispels the contradictions, and shows you how some weird thing, though weird, might be <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>You are going to learn a lot about this beautiful and mind-blowing theory in this class.</p>

<h1 id="section_kinds">Some Examples</h1>

<p>Philosopher W.V.O. Quine was a professor up the road at Harvard in the 50s, and one of the most important philosophers of the 20th Century. He distinguished paradoxes into three kinds. </p>

<p>(Note: Quine’s classification system assumes that we’ve put the paradox in a way that makes it obviously valid, so it’s not an option to deny the validity of the argument. This will mostly be the case for the paradoxes we consider in this class.)</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="section_falsidical">Falsidical Paradoxes</h2>

<p>These are paradoxes where we decide that the right solution is to deny one of the premises, as reluctant as we are to let it go.</p>

<p>Here is a famous example (most people agree), called “Russell’s Paradox”, after it’s discoverer, Bertrand Russell. You might have heard of it. It goes something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>For every condition C such that, for each thing x, x either meets condition C or does not (and not both), there is a set of all things that meet condition C.</li>
<li>If (1), then there is a set of all things that do not have themselves as a member, <em>R</em>.</li>
<li>If <em>R</em> exists, then <em>R</em> both is and is not a member of itself.</li>
<li>Hence, R exists, and both is and is not a member of itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>That conclusion <em>cannot</em> be right.<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="ref1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It is a contradiction. So one of these premises <em>must</em> be false. But that is hard to believe! Let’s consider each premise, in reverse order.</p>

<p>Consider premise 3. It appears to be incontrovertible. The argument goes like this. Suppose <em>R</em> is a member of itself. Then <em>R</em> is not a member of itself, because <em>R</em> does not contain anything that is a member of itself. So if <em>R</em> is a member of itself, it is also not a member of itself.</p>

<p>Now suppose that <em>R</em> is not a member of itself. <em>R</em> is the set of all things that are not members of themselves. So <em>R</em>, then, must be member of itself. So if <em>R</em> is not a member of itself, it also is.</p>

<p>Now, <em>R</em> must be either a member of itself or not. Either way, <em>R</em> both is and is not a member of itself, assuming that it exists.</p>

<p>What about premise 2? That appears to be equally incontrovertible. For each thing in the world, we can ask, “is this thing a member of itself?” and get a definite answer, because everything either is or is not a member of itself, and not both. My computer: not a member of itself. The set of natural numbers: not a member of itself. And so on. So, if premise 1 is true, then it seems that there’s got to be a set of things that are not members of themselves, which is what premise 2 says.</p>

<p>Finally, premise 1. Premise 1 is a way of putting a thesis that Gottlob Frege called “Basic Law V”. (Gottlob Frege was a mathematician and one of the founding figures of analytic philosophy, which the style of philosophy that dominates the English speaking world.) Frege was among the first people to try to formalise set theory, in an attempt to derive mathematics from logic. And he almost did it!</p>

<p>You can see why Frege felt entitled to assume premise 1 as an axiom in his system. It seems totally trivial; isn’t that just what we <em>mean</em> by set? How could it possibly turn out to be false?</p>

<p>And yet, premise 1 is the one we now reject. According to modern set theory, it is not the case, for any well defined condition, there is always a set of things that meet that condition.</p>

<p>Rejecting premise 1 is somewhat tragic. For a start, any way of axiomatising set theory that avoids premise 1 has to, effectively, tell you which conditions you can plug in for ‘C’ in premise 1 and get a set. And there isn’t any unique, completely natural way of doing that, that also gives you a set theory that can answer any question you might want to ask about sets.</p>

<p>But perhaps even more tragic is that giving up premise 1 means that Frege’s dream of deriving mathematics from logic can’t be fulfilled — at least, not in the way he thought.<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="ref2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Russell wrote to Frege about the paradox just before the publication of Frege’s <em>magnum opus</em>, the <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em> in which he seemingly derived arithmetic from basic logical principles. Frege quickly wrote an appendix, which starts with these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hardly anything more undesirable can befall a scientific writer than to have, at the completion of his work, one of the foundation-stones of his edifice shattered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poor Frege!</p>

<p>Sad as it is, what Russell’s paradox shows, it is generally agreed, is that premise 1 is false. Don’t be too sad, though; a lot of very interesting and very important mathematics, logic and philosophy resulted from trying to fix the problem Russell pointed out, including Gödel’s Theorem, which we will talk more about towards the end of this course. Really, Russell’s paradox is a paradox success story.</p>

<h2 id="section_veridical">Veridical Paradoxes</h2>

<p>These are paradoxes where we decide that the right solution is to accept the conclusion after all. The generation unwilling to accept the conclusion dies off, a new generation more used to the idea arises, and we decide we can live with the conclusion. Here’s a (most people agree) veridical paradox:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the speed of light is the same in every frame of reference, then simultaneity is relative to a frame of reference.</li>
<li>The speed of light is the same in every frame of reference.</li>
<li>Therefore, simultaneity is relative to a frame of reference.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is obviously a valid argument. The first premise is basically impossible to deny; you may have seen the little though experiment involving light rays on a train that establishes it. But many people found the conclusion very hard to believe. Imagine you are in the nineteenth century, and someone told you that simultaneity was relative to a frame of reference. The idea would seem ridiculous! It would be hard to understand what that even <em>meant</em>. </p>

<p>So, for most of human history, people thought premise 2 was false. But premise 2 became harder and harder to deny, as more experimental data came in. These days, premise 2 is extremely well confirmed by experiment. </p>

<p>There are a <em>few</em> who still deny premise 2; there are, in fact, ways of explaining the experimental data consistent with premise 2 being false. But it’s a stretch. Basically, we all agree now that the conclusion of the above argument is correct, as surprising as that once was.</p>

<h2 id="section_antinomies">Antinomies</h2>

<p>Antinomies are paradoxes where we just don’t know what to do. With the unstoppable march of philosophical progress, more and more antinomies should become falsidical or veridical paradoxes. But they haven’t yet.</p>

<p>Here’s a paradox that I find totally intractable. For me, this is the mother of antinomies.</p>

<p>Let us suppose I have to make a terrible decision to make. An evil master-mind is making me choose: either one person will be made to suffer excruciating, agonising pain — let’s call that “level 0 pain” —, or a 100 people will be made to suffer pain that is also excruciating, though not <em>quite</em> as excruciating. The difference is barely noticeable, but it is there. Call that “level 1 pain”.</p>

<p>I feel terrible for the poor wretch who gets the level 0 pain, but the choice seems clear; I’ve got to save the 100 from level 1 pain, though that means that solitary guy will get the slightly worse level 0 pain.</p>

<p>But we’re not done! The evil master-mind offers another evil choice: 100 people will be made to suffer level 1 pain, or 10,000 people will be made to suffer pain that is slightly less bad, though the difference, again, is barely noticeable. Call the pain the 10 000 would suffer “level 2 pain”.</p>

<p>Well, it’s awful that 100 people be made to suffer level 1 pain, but suffering level 2 pain is not much better, and 10,000 people is a lot of people! The choice seems clear: I should save the 10,000 from level 2 pain, at the expense of the 100 who will suffer level 1 pain.</p>

<p>But the evil master-mind just keeps her fiendish choices coming! At step <em>n</em>, she offers me a choice between 100^<em>n</em> people suffering level <em>n</em> pain, and 100^<em>n+1</em> people suffering level <em>n</em>+1 pain, which is ever so slightly less bad that level <em>n</em> pain. And at each point it seems that I should choose that the 100^<em>n</em>+1 suffer level <em>n</em>+1 pain, rather than let the 100^<em>n</em> suffer the barely noticeably less bad level <em>n</em> pain.</p>

<p>At the end of this process I am choosing between zillions suffering some barely noticeable pain and zillions upon zillions suffering some even less, though only slightly, noticeable pain, and choosing that the zillions suffer the slightly worse pain.</p>

<p>Ok, so far so good. Here’s the first twist: we usually think that preferences should be <em>transitive</em>. That is, if I prefer A over B, and B over C, then I should prefer A over C. That is a standard assumption in micro-economics. And it seems pretty plausible, right? I mean, isn’t that just part of what we <em>mean</em> when we say we prefer something? Suppose I tell you: I prefer the chocolate ice-cream to the vanilla, and the vanilla to the strawberry. Then you go to the store, and come back with the chocolate. If you then tell me that they only had chocolate and strawberry, wouldn’t it be totally bizzare for me to say “What! I prefer strawberry to chocolate! Why didn’t you call to check?”. Seems that it would.</p>

<p>But then we have a paradox:</p>

<ol>
<li>For every <em>n</em>, you should choose 100^<em>n</em> suffering level <em>n</em> pain over 100^<em>n</em>+1 suffering level <em>n+1</em> pain.</li>
<li>Preferences should be transitive.</li>
<li>Conclusion: I should choose 1 suffering level 0 pain to zillions upon zillions suffering level kajillion pain.</li>
</ol>

<p>I, for one, find this conclusion completely unacceptable. Level kajillion pain is hardly <em>anything</em>. It’s like an itch. There is no number of people you can save from an itch that justifies torturing someone with agonising, excruciating pain, if you ask me.</p>

<p>But I can’t bring myself to reject premise 1! Level <em>n+1</em> pain is <em>barely any different</em> to level <em>n</em> pain. How can it be right to let 100 times more people suffer a pain that is barely noticeably different to the pain in the other option?</p>

<p>So maybe we should reject premise 2; maybe it is not always true that preferences should be transitive. That is a pretty bizarre finding. But even worse, it doesn’t even solve the problem! </p>

<p>For, suppose that, as a final, grotesquely evil <em>piece de resistance</em>, the evil master-mind has you choose between saving either 1 person from level 0 pain, or 100 people from level 1 pain, or… or zillions of people from level kajillion pain. The evil master-mind is going to make all the pain happen except for the level that you choose to be saved. What should you do?</p>

<p>I have no idea. I find this puzzle completely perplexing. Thinking about it hurts my brain. Thinking about it more hurts my soul.</p>

<p>That’s an antinomy. Don’t worry, that’s as bad as it gets. In the rest of the semester, we’ll see puzzles that will blow our minds, but they will leave our souls intact!</p>

</ul>

<p><sup id="fn:1">1. There are a small minority of philosophers who would dispute this; they believe that some contradictions are true. The conclusion of the above argument is a good candidate for a true contradiction, according to them. The view that some contradictions are true is called <em>dialetheism</em>, and its most famous proponent is Graham Priest.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

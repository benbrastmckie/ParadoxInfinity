    \item Hunt and the TAs will expect you to have read through this written material beforehand (eat your vegetables!)
    \item Watching the \textit{videos} on MITx is totally optional 
    \item Hunt will cover some technical basics in class, \\ model problem-solving (active learning woooooo), and \\ supplement with additional philosophical content that willl hopefully secure the ``Humanities'' in this HASS course. 
\item (The problem sets will be mainly technical)

%\item We'll cover the essential content, in a digestible manner \\ (helpful if you find it hard to make time to read)

\item We'll do practice problems! Often geared toward homework questions

\medskip

\item Although this is a problem-based course, I am hoping that you will acquire an appreciation for philosophy

\item (so that later in life, after you're a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager, you think about the little guy up there in the philosophy dept and write some \#\emph{PHAT} checks)

%\item You might gain some `insider information'

\bigskip

%\item This is a \emph{skills-based} course: \\ the goal is to learn how to \emph{do} logic, rather than to memorize or regurgitate facts about logic.

\item Aims at reflective equilibrium (John Rawls; 1921--2002)

\item Aims at exploring logical space (Crispin Wright; 1942--\footnotesize{still kickin'!})

\item Aims at providing therapy for troubled minds \\ (Ludwig Wittgenstein; 1889--1951)

\item Faulkner in his 1950 nobel prize speech: \\ We have ``forgotten the problems of \textit{the human heart in conflict with itself} which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat."
%``The only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself, regardless of genre"
%``the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about, regardless of the genre"
%Actual quote ``Because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat."

\item \emph{Upshot for us}: \textit{The intellect in conflict with itself is the only thing worth philosophizing about}

\item Our course will consider places of tension within modern mathematics, physics, decision theory, and logic 

\item If you are not already disturbed, you may become puzzled.
%like how i felt upon first hearing that there are reasons to be worried about infinity! had never occurred to me. i used infinity all the time! michael friedman talk in 2012 perhaps. 

\item Like Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall, it may be that all the philosophical horses won't be able to put you back together again

\item \emph{Revision}: this ship is f$^{***}$ed; abandon ship!!! 
% Famous examples: folk psychology (churchlands); causation (russell)

\item Note that restriction and revision both involve \textit{rejecting} parts of classical math, to different extents.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textit{Semantic realism}: mathematical claims are true objectively and mind-independently, in a non-deflationary sense. 

\ei

\bigskip

\item \emph{Formalism}: classical mathematics is a rule-governed game (like chess). The rules determine which inferences are permissible.

\item \emph{Logicism}: the permissible parts of math follow from the laws of logic (and we hope that this recovers all of mathematics!)

\item \emph{Structuralism}: mathematical entities exist as functional roles within a structure, similar to how the US president exists only relative to the US (\#LandoftheFree) 
% distinction between in re vs. ante rem structuralism.

% entities perform a functional role within a structure

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Error Theory}: something is seriously amiss with the discourse of classical mathematics, but it is practically effective

\bi
\item \textit{Fictionalism}: mathematical entities are fictional, like our dearly beloved Sherlock Holmes. 
\item Mathematical claims are at most \textit{true in a fiction}. \\ None of these entities \textit{actually} exist.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Ways of Restricting}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Naturalism}: preserve only those parts of math that are instrumentally valuable for physics or natural science. 
\item[] Reject unapplied parts, e.g. higher reaches of set theory 

\medskip 

\item \emph{Constructivism}: ``God made the integers, all else is the work of man" -- Leopold Kronecker (1823--1891)
%criticized Cantor as corrupting the youth!!!

\bi
\item TL;DR: stick to what's computable, son!
\ei

\medskip 

\item \emph{Finitism}: if it ain't finite, it doesn't count.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Intuitionism}: the mind creates mathematics, relying primitively on the notion of time's passing. -- L.E.J. Brouwer (1881--1966)
\bi
\item Comes into conflict with classical mathematics regarding the proper conception of the real numbers and the continuum. 
\item So intuitionism is NOT a restriction of classical math
\ei

%%``Brouwer’s second act of intuitionism gives rise to choice sequences, that provide certain infinite sets with properties that are unacceptable from a classical point of view. A choice sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers (or finite objects) created by the free will. The sequence could be determined by a law or algorithm, such as the sequence consisting of only zeros, or of the prime numbers in increasing order, in which case we speak of a lawlike sequence, or it could not be subject to any law, in which case it is called lawless."

%%sense in which intuitionism is diff from constructivism (but I thought intuitionisitic logic IS a restriction of classical logic?):
%``intuitionism strongly deviates from classical mathematics in the conception of the continuum, which in the former setting has the property that all total functions on it are continuous. Thus, unlike several other theories of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is not a restriction of classical reasoning"
%https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/
%Brouwer history sounds very interesting: ``the most famous one being the conflict with David Hilbert, which eventually led to Brouwer’s expulsion from the board of the Mathematische Annalen. This conflict was part of the Grundlagenstreit that shook the mathematical society at the beginning of the 20th century and that emerged as a result of the appearance of paradoxes and highly nonconstructive proofs in mathematics. "

%%``intuitionism differs from Platonism and formalism, because neither does it assume a mathematical reality outside of us, nor does it hold that mathematics is a play with symbols according to certain fixed rules. " formalism sounds similar to expressivism/norms in some regard. 

%% ``The distinction between intuitionism and other constructive views on mathematics according to which mathematical objects and arguments should be computable, lies in the freedom that the second act allows in the construction of infinite sequences. Indeed, as will be explained below, the mathematical implications of the second act of intuitionism contradict classical mathematics, and therefore do not hold in most constructive theories, since these are in general part of classical mathematics"

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Consider a function $f$ (a.k.a. `map') from a \emph{domain} set $A$ to a \emphz{range} set $B$. We denote this as ``$f: A \rightarrow B$". 

\item To be \emph{well-defined}, EVERY element of $A$ must be mapped by $f$ to exactly one (not necessarily distinct) element of $B$

\item[] $\forall a \in A, \exists ! b \in B$ such that $f(a) = b$

\item[] (Note that the order of the quantifier matters a great deal: $\exists ! b \in B$ s.t. $\forall a \in A$,  $f(a) = b$ is a horizontal line if $A = B = \mathbb{R}$)

\item Note that the \emph{image} of $f$, ``$f(A)$", need not equal the entire range $B$: in general, $f(A) \subseteq B$

\item When the image equals $B$, we say that the function is \emph{onto}, a.k.a. ``a \emph{surjection}"

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item If you are asked to prove something that involves constructing a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, you ought to first show that the function is \emph{well-defined}:

\item i.e. that each element of the domain is sent to a unique element of the range

\item Basically, given an arbitrary $a \in A$, argue (i) that $f(a) \in B$ and that (ii) if there are $b \neq b'$ in $B$ such that both $b = f(a)$ and $b' = f(a)$ then we have a contradiction. 

\item Often, it is so seemingly `obvious' that a function is well-defined, that explicitly proving this will seem tedious and annoying.

\item[] \textit{spoiler}: philosophers have a tendency to be tedious ;) 

%\item Note that every element in the domain is sent to a single element in the range

% Note that the motivation for requiring functions to be well-defined is actually kind of interesting. You need different representatives of the same number to be sent to the same value, e.g. f(0.5) to equal f(1/2) and f(1) to equal f(0.9999999999)

\item You come home from math class one day and are super pumped to tell your parents, siblings, mailperson, and anyone willing to listen a MIND-BLOWING FACT: \textit{there are as many even numbers as odd and even numbers together}!

\item For those willing to listen, they tell you that you must be out of your god d*** mind: clearly, there are more natural numbers, since the evens are a proper subset of the natural numbers.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textit{Hold your ground}: you're the one in the math class after all! Your layperson interlocutor doesn't know what's up!

\item \textit{Reject}: agree with your interlocutor that the mathematicians are up to something pretty strange. 

\item \textit{A therapeutic response}: you learned a technical sense of `size' in your math class that tracks the existence of bijections. 
\bi
\item You're basically just saying that there is a bijection between the even numbers and the naturals. 
\item That is interesting, but not nearly as cool sounding as saying that the evens have the same \emphz{size}$_{subset}$ as the naturals, which is probably how your interlocutor understood you.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item We keep talking about the ordinals, but we can prove that there cannot exist a set of all ordinal numbers

\item In general, there can be no such thing as the set of all sets. Such a set would have to be a member of itself, and hence fail to contain every set.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Here's one solution: declare it impermissible to form a set from an arbitrary property (reject ``unrestricted comprehension")

\item Axiom of separation/comprehension: it is permissible to form a set of objects that have a given property provided that they belong to a given set. 

\item i.e. any definable subclass of a set is itself a set 
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_specification

\item But if a class of individuals exists, why can't we in general form a \textit{set}??? If there is no set, might we worry that some of the individuals in fact do not exist?

\item Does it start to feel like we are playing a game rather than surveying Platonic space?

\item Alternatively, given that our meta-language contains predicates that refer to classes that are not sets within our theory, might we worry that our theory is \textit{missing something}

% Our metalanguage contains predicates that do not refer to any sets within the theory

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Consider a function $f$ (a.k.a. `map') from a \emph{domain} set $A$ to a \emphz{range} set $B$. We denote this as ``$f: A \rightarrow B$". 

\item To be \emph{well-defined}, EVERY element of $A$ must be mapped by $f$ to exactly one (not necessarily distinct) element of $B$

\item[] $\forall a \in A, \exists ! b \in B$ such that $f(a) = b$

\item[] (Note that the order of the quantifier matters a great deal: $\exists ! b \in B$ s.t. $\forall a \in A$,  $f(a) = b$ is a horizontal line if $A = B = \mathbb{R}$)

\item Note that the \emph{image} of $f$, ``$f(A)$", need not equal the entire range $B$: in general, $f(A) \subseteq B$

\item When the image equals $B$, we say that the function is \emph{onto}, a.k.a. ``a \emph{surjection}": $\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A$ s.t. $f(a) = b$

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item If you are asked to prove something that involves constructing a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, you ought to first show that the function is \emph{well-defined}:

\item i.e. that each element of the domain is sent to a unique element of the range

\item Is $f(x) = x^2$ where $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ well-defined? 
%no! e.g. 1/2 squared is 1/4 which is not in Naturals 

\item Basically, given an arbitrary $a \in A$, argue (i) that $f(a) \in B$ and that (ii) if there are $b \neq b'$ in $B$ such that both $b = f(a)$ and $b' = f(a)$ then we have a contradiction. 

\item Often, it is so seemingly `obvious' that a function is well-defined, that explicitly proving this will seem tedious and annoying.

\item[] \textit{spoiler}: philosophers have a tendency to be tedious ;) 

%\item Note that every element in the domain is sent to a single element in the range

% Note that the motivation for requiring functions to be well-defined is actually kind of interesting. You need different representatives of the same number to be sent to the same value, e.g. f(0.5) to equal f(1/2) and f(1) to equal f(0.9999999999)

Today they are invented on purpose to show that our ancestor's reasoning was at fault, and we shall never get anything more than that out of them.

\item Should we think that our concept is simply one of many that could be fruitful or interesting to focus on?

%e.g. maybe we should be focused on notion of morphism (generalization of homomorphism)in category theory. functions between sets are a special case of a morphism.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emphz{Proper Subset Principle}: if $A \subset B$, then B has more members than A. 
%logically, this is giving us a sufficient condition for difference in size 

\item[] e.g. $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$ entails that there ``are more" integers than natural numbers (note: this is an apocryphal statement for the PSets!) 

\item \emph{Bijection Principle}: set $A$ has the same `size' as set $B$ if and only if there is a bijection from $A$ to $B$ 
%logically, this is giving necessary and sufficient conditions for same size. 
%so logically playing a different functional role than PSP, right from the start 

\item[] i.e. identify `size' with \textbf{cardinality} 

\item For many finite sets, these principles agree, but they disagree for infinite sets
% but they definitely don't agree for all finite sets, e.g. {0, 1, 2} vs. {3, 4, 5} have same size according to bijection principle but not according to proper subset principle! 
% Perhaps in the finite case, we can take bijection principle to be sufficient but not necessary for sameness of size. And proper subset principle is sufficient for difference in size?
% It does seem to be a problem that the proper subset principle cares about the identity of the elements, rather than just a more structural relationship

% % An improved proper subset principle? B has more members than A provided there exists sets C and D such that there is a bijection from B to D and A to C such that C is a proper subset of D

\item \emphz{Proper Subset Principle}:

\item Intuitively, there are more rational numbers than natural numbers, since $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Q}$

\item Con: is mathematically sterile or `uninteresting' for infinite sets
% maybe one reason why proper subset principle is relatively uninteresting is that it is too restrictive to always have to focus on subsets. We want a more flexible notion, that allows for more isomorphisms between structures we could use for counting.

\ei

\item \emph{Bijection Principle}:

\item Is mathematically fruitful! 
%arguably b/c cardinality defines a total ordering on sets, so clear answers for size comparisons! 

\item Aside: what is fruitfulness in mathematics? \\ -- What does it mean for a bit of mathematics to be `interesting'?

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Here's one solution: declare it impermissible to form a set from an arbitrary property (reject ``unrestricted comprehension")

\item Axiom of separation/comprehension: it is permissible to form a set of objects that have a given property provided that they belong to a given set. 

\item i.e. any definable subclass of a set is itself a set 
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema_of_specification

\item But if a class of individuals exists, why can't we in general form a \textit{set}??? If there is no set, might we worry that some of the individuals in fact do not exist?

\item Does it start to feel like we are playing a game rather than surveying Platonic space?

\item Alternatively, given that our meta-language contains predicates that refer to classes that are not sets within our theory, might we worry that our theory is \textit{missing something}

% Our metalanguage contains predicates that do not refer to any sets within the theory

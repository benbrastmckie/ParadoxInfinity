# tkz-graph â€” for graph theory

Release 2.0 2021/01/20

## Description

The package tkz-graph.sty is a collection of some useful macros if you want to
 draw manually a graph of the graph theory. The kind of graphs that I will
  present, are sometimes called combinatorial graphs to distinguish them from
  the graphs of functions. The macros are designed to give math
 teachers (and students) easy access at the programmation of drawing graphs
  with  TikZ.  I therefore hope that my  packages provide  ideal tools for
   teachers wanting to offer their students fine documents of maths.

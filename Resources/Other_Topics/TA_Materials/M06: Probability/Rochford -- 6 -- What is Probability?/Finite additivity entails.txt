Finite additivity entails that the probability of a disjunction of finitely many propositions — i.e., something like this \[p_1\vee p_2\vee p_3\vee\ldots\vee p_n\] — must equal the sum of the probability of the disjuncts — i.e., it must equal the probability of \(p_1\) plus the probability of \(p_2\) plus \ldots plus the probability of \(p_n\) — when p_1 through p_n are mutually exclusive. But it does *not* entail that this is so when there are *infinitely* many propositions in the big disjunction. The usual version of 2 covers one extra case: it entails that, when there are as many propositions as natural numbers in the big disjunction, still, the probability of the disjunction must equal the sum of the probabilities of the disjuncts. However, the usual version of 2 does *not* entail that this is true for any larger cardinalities. For this reason, the usual version of 2 is called “countable additivity”. We will talk more about countable additivity later.

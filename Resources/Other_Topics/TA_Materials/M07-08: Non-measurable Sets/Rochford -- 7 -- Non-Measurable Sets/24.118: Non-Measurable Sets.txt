#Non-Measurable Sets [section_nonmeasurable]

## Measure [section_measure]

We’ve seen that the number of points in any interval of the real line is the same as any other. So the number of points in \([0,\frac{1}{2}]\) is the same as the number of points in \([0,1]\), which is the same as the number of points in \([0, 5,000,000]\), which is the same as the number of points in the whole real line. Similar things are true for subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(\mathbb{R}^3\), and beyond.

So a set of points does not, by itself, have properties like length, area, and volume. You need to add some extra structure. The extra structure you need to add is called, in mathematics, a *measure*. 

A **measure** on a set of points \(S\) is a way of assigning real numbers to subsets of \(S\). You can think of it as a function \(\mu\) (usually transcribed as “mu” in English, pronounced “myu”), from \(\mathcal{P}(S)\),[^fn_sigma] the set of subsets of \(S\), to real numbers.[^fn_extended]

[^fn_sigma]: Actually, for reasons related to what we’re going to talk about, the domain of measure is not always a power set; sometimes it is a special subset of a power set. In general, the domain of a measure has to be what is called a “\(sigma\)-algebra” (read “sigma-algebra”). Power sets are always \(sigma\)-algebras, but not every \(sigma\)-algebra is a power set, or even isomorphic to a power set, though they are always isomorphic to a subset of some power set.

[^fn_extended]: Strictly speaking, a measure doesn’t have to always assign a real number. There is an extra number, called “\(+\inf\)”, which is bigger than any real number, which is allowed to be in the range of a measure. For instance, if \(S\) is an entire space of points, like \(\mathbb{R}^2\), then you might want your measure to assign \(+\inf\) to \(S\).

A measure is not just any way of assigning numbers to subsets of \(S\). It has to meet some constraints:

1. It must assign 0 to the empty set.
2. It must assign some non-negative real number (or \(+\inf\) — see footnote above) to every set.
3. Countable additivity: For countably many disjoint subsets \(s_0, s_1,s_2\ldots\), the measure of their union must equal the sum of the measures of each set.

##Measures and Probability [section_mandp]

This  above constraints might sound familiar. There is an analogous constraint for each of them, when it comes to probability functions. In fact, you can think of a probability function as just a special kind of measure. (Explaining exactly how would take a while, but believe me, it’s true.)

Measures are more general than probability function, in two ways: 
1. measures can be defined over many more things than the set of propositions, and
2. measures can assign bigger numbers than 1.
But otherwise a measure and a probability function are very similar. 

And here is a further connection. Suppose you are picking points out of a set of points \(S\) by some method, and there is a probability function \(P\) which tells you, for any given subset of \(S\), what the probability is of picking a point in that subset. Then the function that assigns to each subset the probability of picking a point in that subset is a measure.

So, for instance, suppose I pick a point from the interval \([0,1]\) using the following method: I flip a fair coin as many times as there are natural numbers. When I flip a Head, I write down a “0”. When I flip a Tail, I write down a “1”. Then I write down a “0.” at the beginning of my sequence of “0”s and “1”s. What I have now written down is the binary expression of the number I have picked.

If you follow this procedure, the probability of picking a number in the interval \([0, \frac{1}{2}]\), for instance, is a \(\frac{1}{2}\). And the probability of getting a number in either the interval \([0,\frac{1}{4}]\) or the interval \([\frac{1}{2}, 1]\) is also \(\frac{3}{4}\). And so on.

So the function that assigns \(\frac{1}{2}\) to \([0,\frac{1}{2}]\), and \(\frac{3}{4}\) to \([0,\frac{1}{4}]\cup[\frac{3}{4},1]\), and so on, is a measure.[^fn_converse]

[^fn_converse]: This isn’t so important for our purposes, but you can usually go the other way too. More precisely: suppose you have a measure \(\mu\) on a set \(S\) which does not assign \(+\inf\) to any subset (again, see footnote above). Then there is a probability function such that \[P(t|u)=\frac{\mu(T)}{\mu(U)}\], where T, U are subsets of S such that the measure assigns T and U and t, u are the propositions that you pick a point in T and that you pick a point in U, respectively.

##Lebesgue Measure [section_lebesgue]

The measure that corresponds to the coin-toss procedure above has a name. It is called the “Lebesgue Measure”.

The Lebesgue Measure is the most important measure. It is the one that accords with our everyday notion of spatial quantity. The Lebesgue measure over [0,1] assigns each interval what we would usually call it’s “length”.

You can generalise the Lebesgue Measure. The measure over \(\mathbb{R}\) assigns to the interval [0,1] the number 1, assigns to the interval [3,4] the number 1, assigns to the interval [-3, 27] the number 30, and in general assigns to each interval its length. The Lebesgue measure over \(\mathbb{R}^2\) assign subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) what you would usually think of as their areas. The Lebesgue measure over \(mathbb{R}^3\) assigns every subset of \(\mathbb{R}\) its volume.

And so on. The Lebesgue measure is well defined over \(\mathbb{R}^n\), for any finite \(n\).

The distinctive thing about the Lebesgue Measure is that it is **uniform** — i.e., it is *invariant under isometries*. What that means, roughly, is: if some subset \(S\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) has a certain Lebesgue measure, then every subset of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) that has the same shape and size as \(S\) has the same Lebesgue measure.

Another way of putting this: if you take \(S\), and translate it, or rotate it, or reflect it, to get another subset \(S’\) of \(\mathbb{R}^n\), then \(S’\) is guaranteed to have the same Lebesgue measure as \(S\).

##Missing Measure [section_missing]

Let is confine out attention to the interval [0,1], just for the sake of simplicity; versions of what I say below are true more generally/

The Lebesgue Measure is well-defined for individual points in [0,1]. It is, in fact, 0, for every individual point. (Excerise: show this is so via considering the coin-flip method of picking a point in [0,1].) This is as you would expect; the length of any individual point is 0. Similarly, by countable additivity, and union of countably many individual points has Lebesgue measure 0.

The Lebesgue Measure is well-defined for intervals. It is, as we said, just the length of that interval. So, by countable additivity, the union of countably many intervals has a well-defined Lebesgue Measure. It is the sum of all the lengths of the intervals.

Does *any* subset of [0,1] have a well-defined Lebesgue Measure? The standard answer, shockingly, is no.

Why is that so shocking? For a start, it means that there are sets in the interval [0,1] such that the probability of choosing a point in that set, using the coin-flip method, is not well-defined. There is just no fact of the matter, when it comes to how likely it is that you will choose a number in that set. I have trouble understanding what that even means.

It also means that there are sets such that there is no fact of the matter concerning what proportion of the length of [0,1] is contributed by that set.

It also means that, if you had a some mass distributed evenly over the interval [0,1], then there would be subsets of [0,1] with no well-defined mass.

In short, the claim that there are sets no Lebesgue measure, if true, means that our ordinary notions of length, area, volume, mass and so on are much weirder than we thought

A consequence of this fact is the result called the Banach-Tarski theorem, perhaps the strangest result in all of mathematics, which we will discuss next lecture. 

This conclusion, that there are sets with no Lebesgue measure, came as a huge surprise, and was very controversial, when it was first argued for. The fact that they exist leads to very strange things. We will think about what to make of this at the end of this topic.

A set with no Lebesgue measure is called a **non-measurable set**.

#Vitali Sets [section_Vitali]

[Giuseppe Vitali][link_vitali] was an Italian mathematician who lived at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th Centuries. He was the first to describe non-measurable sets. The sets he describes are now called *Vitali sets*. In this section, I’ll show you how to define them, and how to prove that they are non-measurable.

[link_vitali]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Vitali

##Constructing Vitali Sets [section_constructing]

###Orbits [section_orbits]

Let us say that two numbers \(a,b\in [0,1]\) are in the same *orbit* if and only if \(a-b\) is a rational number.

For instance, \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{1}{6}\) are in the same orbit because \(\frac{1}{2}−\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\), which is a rational number. Similarly, \(\pi - 3\) and \(\pi - \frac{25}{8}\) are in the same orbit because \((\pi-3)-(\pi-\frac{25}{8})=\frac{1}{8}\). But \(\frac{1}{2} and \(\pi-3\) are not in the same orbit because their difference is not a rational number.

The relation of differing by a rational number is an equivalence relation; that is, it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. This entails that every number in \([0,1]\) is in exactly one orbit.

How many numbers are there in an orbit? Well, take an arbitrary number — say, \(a\). Every number in \(a\)’s orbit differs from \(a\) by some rational number. Moreover, there are at most two numbers that differ from \(a\) by any given rational number \(r\) — namely, \(a+r\) and \(a-r\). So there are no more than two times the number of rational numbers in an orbit. That is a countable number. So there are countably many numbers in an orbit.

How may orbits are there? Well, the union of all the orbits is the entire interval [0,1], which has an uncountable cardinality. But the union of countably many countable sets has countable cardinality (you proved this on a problem set back in Topic 3). So, given that each orbit has countable cardinality, there must be uncountably many of them.

A **Vitali Set** is a set that contains exactly one element from each orbit. Note that we need the Axiom of Choice to establish that there is such a set.

##Vitali Sets are Non-Measurable [section_vsnon]

Take the interval \([0,1]\), and wrap around into a circle with circumference 1. Wrap it clockwise, so that number go up as you go clockwise around the circle, until you get back to the 0.

Now, consider some Vitali Set \(V\) of points in that circle. Let \(V_q\) be the set you get by moving each point in \(V\) along the circle clockwise by some rational number \(q\in[0,1]\). That is, you get \(V_q\) by rotating \(V\) by \(q\) units around the circle, where \(q\) is a rational number in \([0,1]\).

There are many \(V_q\)s — one for every rational number in \([0,1]\). Together, they partition [0,1] — that is, every point in \([0,1]\) is in exactly one \(V_q\). How do we know that? \(V\) contains exactly one point for every orbit. That means that, for each \(x\in [0,1]\), there is exactly one point in \(y\in V\) such that \(x-y=r\) is a rational number ( \(r\in [0,1]\), given that \(x,y\in [0,1]\)). So there is precisely one \(V_q\) that \(x\) will be in. If \(r\) is positive, \(x\in V_r\). If \(r\) is negative, \(x\in V_{1-r}\).

To summarise: the following is true of the \(V_q\)s:
1. There are countably many \(V_q\)s (one for each rational number in \([0,1]\)).
2. The \(V_q\)s are disjoint.
3. The union of all the \(V_q\)s is the entirety of \([0,1]\).
4. Each \(V_q\) is a translation of \(V\), and, consequently, has the same shape and size as \(V\).

Let \(\lambda\) be the Lebesgue Measure. Points (1)-(3), together with the countable additivity of measures, entail that, if \(\lambda(V_q)\) is defined, then \[\lambda(V_{q_0}) + \lambda(V_{q_1} + \lambda(V_{q_2}) + \ldots = \lambda([0,1]) = 1\] Point (4), together with the uniformity of the Lebesgue Measure, entails that, if \(\lambda(V_q)\) is defined, then \[\lambda(V_{q_0}=\lambda(V_{q_1})=\lambda(V_{q_2}) = \ldots\] But there is no real number that can satisfy both of these equations. So \(\lamba(V_q)\) is not defined. That is: Vitali Sets are non-measurable.

# The Banach-Tarski Theorem [section_bttheorem]

We have shown that there are non-measurable sets. That is a bit upsetting. How can there be points in \([0,1]\) such that there is no well-defined probability of choosing such a point, via the coin-flip procedure? How can there be regions of \([0,1]\) with no well-defined length? How can there be regions of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) with no well-defined are? How can there be regions of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with no well-defined volume?

These are upsetting questions. But they’re not so upsetting. We’ve seen things maybe more upsetting than that already in the class. Maybe we can get used to it.

I am now going to show you a consequence of the fact that there are non-measurable sets that is much, much more upsetting. It might be, the strangest result in all of mathematics. It is called the *Banach-Tarski Theorem*:

>**Banach-Tarski Theorem**
>It is possible to divide a ball into five pieces and reassemble the pieces (without changing their size or shape) so as to get two balls, each of them of the same size as the original ball.

We won’t do the proof in full detail; we’ll just do enough to get the idea. Prepare yourself for insanity.

##Warm-Ups [section_warmups]

###Case 1: A Line [section_line]

Take the infinitely long line, and remove a single point, \(p\): 

A line, with a single point missing in the middle.

Is it possible to divide the broken line into subsets \(A\) and \(B\), and then move those subsets around, without changing their size or shape, so as to get an unbroken line?

Remarkably, the answer is “Yes!”. And showing how to do it will be a good warm-up exercise.

The trick is just like the one we use to make room for Onyeka in Hilbert’s Hotel.

Consider the points \(\{(p+1), (p+2), (p+3), \ldots\}\). Those are together going to be subset \(A\). The rest of the line is subset \(B\)

In the diagram below, the points in \(B\) are coloured black, the points in \(A\) are coloured red, and a blank is left for \(p\):

The same picture as above, except there is a point highlighted one unit to the right of the missing point, and two units to the right, and three units, and so on.

The points in \(A\) will be a little easier to see if I move them up a bit:

The same as above, with the highlighted points raised above the line, leaving the line punctured at intervals of one unit from the original missing point.

The next step is to translate \(A\) one unit to the left.

The same as above, with the highlighted points, which are now above the line, all moved one unit to the left. This leaves every hole, including the original one, with a highlighted points above it.

When we look at the translated \(A\) and \(B\), together it’s clear that they combine to form an unbroken line:

The same picture as above, except with all the points moved back down into the line, leaving the line unbroken.

Success! We divided our broken line into two pieces, reassembled the pieces (without changing their size or shape), and ended up with an unbroken line.

###Case 2: A Circle [section_circle]

Here’s a slightly harder problem. Think of a unit circle as a set of points, and consider the result of removing a single point \(p\) from our circle:

A circle, with its rightmost point missing.
 

Can we separate the circle into two subsets \(A\) and \(B\), like we did for the line, and reassemble then move them around without changing their size or shape so as to get an unbroken circle?

Again, the answer is “Yes!”. The only difference is that this time we’ll have to be a little bit more clever about how we select \(A\) and \(B\).

To define \(B\), we’ll start going clockwise around the circle. The first point in \(B\) is the point \(p_1\) which is 1 unit clockwise from \(p\). The second point in \(B\) is the point \(p_2\) which is 2 units clockwise from \(p\). And so forth. The picture below represents the first seven points in \(B\):



The same circle as above, with a points highlighted. The first highlighted point is one unit clockwise from the missing point. The second point is two units clockwise. And so on. Seven such points are highlighted. The last one is more than 360 degrees from the missing point; it's inbetween the missing point and the first highlighted point.

Since the radius of \(S^1\) is one unit, we can prove that the points \(p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots\) are all distinct. (We can prove, in other words, that if one starts at \(p\), moves one unit clockwise, then another unit clockwise, then another, and so forth, one will never return to a location one had already visited.)

(To see this, suppose otherwise. Suppose, in other words, that \(p_i = p_j\) for some \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(i <j\). Then it must be the case that you can get to \(p_j\) by starting at \(p_i\) and advancing \(j -i\) units clockwise.  Since the circumference of \(S^1\) is \(2\pi\), this means that  \(j-i = n \cdot 2\pi\), where \(n\) is some positive integer. But this is impossible, since \(2 \pi\) is an irrational number.)

So we have defined \(B\) and we know that it consists of infinitely many distinct points. We can now define \(A\) as whatever is left over after removing \(B\) from \((S^1 - \{p\})\), In other words: \(A = (S^1-\{p\}) - B\).

The next step is to move the points in \(B\). But in this case the movement will consist of a rotation: we will define the set \(B^r\) as the result of rotating each point in \(B\) one unit counter-clockwise.

It is then easy to verify that \(A \cup B^r = S^1\). For the result of rotating \(p_1\) one unit counterclockwise is \(p\), and the the result of rotating \(p_2\) one unit counterclockwise is \(p_1\), and the result of rotating \(p_3\) one unit counterclockwise is \(p_2\), and so forth.

Voilà! We have divided our broken circle into two pieces, reassembled them (whithout changing their size of shape), and ended up with an unbroken circle!

##The Cayley Graph [section_cayley]

Here is our trickiest challenge yet. We’re going to start with a certain set of points, divide it into finitely many parts, rearrange the parts, and end up with two copies of the original set of points.

The set of points we’re interested in consists of the vertices of a Cayley Graph. The best way to think of a Cayley Graph is as an infinite collection of paths. Each path starts from a central point \(c\), and is the result of taking an infinite sequence of steps. In the first step you advance one unit; in the second step you advance half a unit; in the third step you advance a quarter of a unit; and so forth. Each step is taken in one of four directions (up, down, right or left), with the restriction that one is forbidden from following opposite directions in adjacent steps. The result is this:

Cayley Graph

[Cayley image, courtesy of Aizenr on Wikimedia. License CC BY-SA. See here.]

Now focus your attention on the set \(C^v\) of vertices of the Cayley Graph. (In other words: \(C^v\) is the set consisting of point \(c\), together with each of the points at which a path gets divided in three.)

What I would like to do is this. I’d like to divide \(C^v\) into a finite number of parts, rearrange the parts (without changing their size or shape), and end up with two copies of \(C^v\).

Unfortunately, that can’t quite be done. But we can come close: we can divide \(C^v\) into a finite number of parts, rearrange the parts (changing sizes but not shapes), and end up with two copies of \(C^v\). (We’ll soon consider a slight variation of \(C^v\), in which we can get everything we want.)

So, let us divide \(C^v\) into finitely many parts!  (I’m going to start by ignoring the central vertex \(c\), and divide \(C^v - \{c\}\) into four different parts. I'll tell you how to deal with \(c\) later.)

We’ll divide \(C^v - \{c\}\) into four ‘quadrants’: \(T\) (for top), \(B\) (for bottom), \(L\) (for left) and \(R\) (for right). 

Now focus your attention on \(R\). \(R\) is actually a miniature version of \(C^v - L\). So one can generate a perfect copy of \(C^v\) by putting together an expanded copy of \(R\) with an ordinary copy of \(L\).

Similarly, one can generate a perfect copy of \(C^v\) by putting together an expanded copy of \(B\) with an ordinary copy of \(T\).

An animation of this process is below. As you’ll see, the original single graph is divided up. Quadrants \(R\) and \(B\) expand and connect with \(L\) and \(T\), respectively, to result in two Cayley graphs identical to the original.

Cayley copy

[Cayley animation, courtesy of קובי כרמל on Wikimedia. License CC BY-SA. See here.]

We’re almost done. All that’s left to do is to deal with the central vertex, \(c\). For we didn’t use \(c\) in building our new copies of \(C^v\), and our new copies both have centers. So we currently have no place to put \(c\). 

Fortunately, there is a trick that allows us to include it, and it’s similar to the trick we used earlier to turn the broken line into an unbroken line. Rather than dividing the original graph into four pieces, one can divide it into five, with the fifth piece consisting of \(c\) together with all vertices that lie on the straight line going down from \(c\). This would allow us to build one of our two copies from: (a) an expanded version of the top quadrant, (b) the bottom quadrant except for the fifth piece, and (c) a contracted version of the fifth piece. So we can do the whole thing properly with five pieces, two of which we expand, and one of which we shrink.

##Cayley on a Sphere

We will now construct a modified version of the Cayley Graph — a version in which the graph is wrapped around the surface of the sphere.

As in the case of the original graph, our modified graph will consist in an infinite number of paths. Each path starts from a ‘center’, \(c\), which can be any point we like on the surface of the sphere.

You follow a path by starting at \(c\) and taking an infinite number of steps. Each step consists in rotating the sphere by a particular angle \(\theta\). As before, you’re allowed to take steps four possible directions: you’re allowed to perform “up”, “down”, “left” and “right” rotations. And, as before, you’re never allowed to follow a step with its inverse.

Let me explain how these “up”, “down”, “left” and “right” rotations work. Imagine that you’re holding the sphere in your hand. (Or even better, go get a sphere, and follow along with it.) Say that the \(z\)-axis is the line that runs from the ground you’re standing on to the sky, through the centre of the sphere, and that the \(x\)-axis is a line orthogonal to the \(z\)-axis. To fix ideas, I shall assume that it is the line that runs from your left to your right through the center of the sphere. 

‘Left’ and ‘Right’ steps are rotations of \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) degrees (respectively) about the \(z\)-axis. ‘Down’ and ‘Up’ steps are rotations of \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) degrees (respectively) about the \(x\)-axis.

Now, as it turns out, careful choice of the rotation angle \(\theta\) delivers the following result: one can never get to the same point via different paths. (I won’t prove this here, but one value for \(\theta\) that delivers this result is \(arccos(1/3)\).)

To see how this works, suppose you orient the sphere so that the \(z\)-axis passes through the sphere’s North and  South poles, and suppose that a friend is standing in front of you with a pencil. Your ask your friend to place the tip of the pencil at point \(c\), which we’ll choose to be the point where the sphere’s Equator intersects its Prime Meridian. 

Now suppose you start by rotating the sphere one step ‘Left’. In other words, you rotate the sphere \(\theta\) degrees about the \(z\)-axis. The result that the tip of your friend’s pencil has moved East of the Prime Meridian, and is now positioned on the sphere’s Equator at a longitude of \(\theta\) degrees East. 

Next suppose you rotate the sphere one step ‘Down’. In other words, you rotate the sphere \(\theta\) degrees about the \(x\)-axis. The result is that the tip of your friend’s pencil has moved North of the equator, and is now positioned  on the sphere at a latitude of \(\theta\) degrees North and a longitude of \(\theta\) degrees East.

Would you have ended up in the same place had you had first rotated the sphere one step ‘Down’ and then rotated the sphere one step ‘Left’? Crucially, no.

This is what would have happened if you had rotated Down-Left, rather than Left-Down. After your first rotation, the tip of the pencil would have been located on the sphere’s Prime Meridian, at a latitude of \(\theta\) degrees North. But as you carried out your second rotation, the tip of the pencil would not have stayed at the \(\theta\) degrees North parallel, because the tip of the pencil always travels on a great circle and that parallel is not a great circle. (When \(\theta = arccos(1/3)\), and you rotate Down-Left, the tip of the pencil ends up about 52.21 degrees South and 12.75 degrees East of the location you would have ended up at after rotating Left-Down.)

(Here it is important to keep in mind that the axes of rotation are fixed by the environment in which the sphere is placed, rather than by particular points on the surface of the sphere. The \(z\)-axis, for example, will always point towards the sky, even if you rotate the sphere so that its north pole no longer points towards the sky.)

The set \(C^v_{S^1}\) of vertices of our modified Graph is simply the set of points which can reach the tip of the pencil after some finite sequence of rotations.

So we have a modified version of the Cayley Graph, wrapped up around a sphere. The set \(C^v_{S^1}\) of vertices of our modified Graph is simply our ‘center’ point, \(c\), plus every point which can be reached from \(c\) by applying some finite sequence of rotations.

A crucial difference between our sphere-Graph and the original Cayley Graph is that, in the original Cayley Graph, our steps got smaller and smaller. (They had to, to avoid overlaps; if the steps were all the same size, then, for example, stepping left and then up would get you to the same point as stepping up and the left.) But on our sphere Cayley Graph, steps are always the same size. And since the rotation angle \(\theta\) is chosen so as to guarantee that you never get to the same point via different paths, we never get any overlaps!

(Here you might find it helpful to think back to Warm Up Case 2, above. The fact that our sphere-graph can have steps of the same size and never end up with overlaps is a sophisticated version of the fact that the circle in Warm Up Case 2 can have steps the same size and never end up with overlap.)

##Duplicating Sphere-Cayley

Now for the amazing thing. The same procedure that we had earlier used to duplicate the set of vertices of the original Cayley Graph can be used to duplicate the set of vertices of our modified graph. *But in this case we do not need to change the size or shape of any pieces.*

Just like the set of vertices of the original graph could be divided into quadrants, so the set of vertices of the modified graph can be divided into “quadrants”.  Why the scare quotes? Because the “quadrants” will be all mixed up with each-other, with points all over the sphere. But each quadrant is still well-defined. The “Top” quadrant of the sphere-Cayley, for example, is the set of points that you can get to following a path that starts from the centre and starts with an “up” rotation.

As before, the “Right” quadrant will have exactly the same shape as the set of vertices minus the “Left” quadrant, but this time it will also have exactly the same size! The only difference between the two is that they have different locations on the surface of the sphere. So if we were to rotate the entire Right quadrant \(-\theta\) degrees about the \(z\)-axis, we would get the entire set of vertices minus the Left quadrant. (And something analogous is true for each of the other quadrants.)

We can therefore decompose our set of vertices, \(C^v_{S^1}\), into finitely many parts, and reassemble the parts (without changing their shape or size) so as to get two copies of \(C^v_{S^1}\). All we need to do is carry out the following procedure. Start by dividing the \(C^v_{S^1}\) into quadrants. Then take the Right quadrant, rotate it \(–\theta\) degrees about the \(z\)-axis, and put it together with the Left quadrant. This gives us our first copy of \(C^v_{S^1}\). Next, take the Top quadrant, rotate it \(–\theta\) degrees about the \(x\)-axis, and put it together with the Bottom quadrant. This gives us our second copy of \(C^v_{S^1}\).

So we now have a way to duplicate a special set of points on the surface of a sphere. That isn’t quite duplicating the sphere; it’s not even duplicating the whole surface of the sphere, since not every point on the surface is in \(C^v_{S^1}\). But we’re getting closer. Read on…

##Many Cayleys on a Sphere

Let us say that two points on the surface of our sphere are in the same orbit if and only if one can get from one to the other using a finite number of rotations of the sort described above. Clearly, that’s an equivalence relation, so these orbits partition the surface of the sphere.

Each orbit is, in effect, the set of vertices of a modified Cayley Graph, with one crucial difference: whereas modified Cayley Graphs have a designated centre, there is nothing about an orbit that tells us which of its points to count as its ’centre’. Let me explain.

In the case of an ordinary Cayley Graph you can tell which of the vertices is is the centre of the graph just by looking: it is the vertex surrounded by four paths of maximum length. When it comes to orbits, in contrast, no vertex looks special, because they are all generated by rotations of the same size. If you were standing on a given vertex and looked around at all your fellow vertices, you would see exactly the same site as you would see if you were standing at any other vertex.

Since orbits have no natural centre, we will choose an arbitrary point from each orbit, and treat it as the orbit’s ’centre’. (This requires the Axiom of Choice.)

Once we’ve chosen a centre for each of our orbits, each of our orbits becomes a modified Cayley Graph, wrapped around the sphere. And this allows us to divide the sphere into ‘quadrants’. The ‘top quadrant’ of the sphere, for example, will be the union of ‘top quadrants’ of sets of vertices of our infinitely many modified Cayley Graphs.

This gives us a procedure for duplicating the surface of the ball. Start by dividing into ‘quadrants’, as just described. Next, take the ‘right quadrant’, rotate it \(-\theta\) degrees about the \(z\)-axis, and put it together with the “left quadrant”. That gives us our first copy of the surface. Then take the ‘top quadrant’, rotate it \(-\theta\) degrees about the \(x\)-axis, and put it together with the ‘bottom quadrant’. That gives us our second copy of the surface.

And once we know how to duplicate the surface of the sphere, it is easy to duplicate the entire sphere. We can use the same procedure as before, but rather than working with points on the surface of the sphere, we work with the lines that connect the centre of the sphere with each point.

And there we have it! We’ve started with one sphere and got two! Bananas!

##Pesky Points

Actually, we haven’t *quite* finished, though we’ve said all the important things there are to say. There are still some irritating little complications to take care of.

The first complication is that we didn’t say what to do with the centre of the sphere. The second complication is that we didn’t say what to do with all the centres that we chose for all the Cayley graphs on the surface of the sphere. The third complication is that, depending on which points we pick as centres, it is possible for some points to both be a centre and be in one of the quadrants (this has to do with the fact that, whenever you rotate the sphere, the points at the axis of rotation don’t move, so if a centre is one of those points, it can be taken to itself by a rotation).

We take care of all these little complications in something like our warm up cases, with the line and the circle: we pick a countable number of points, with all the possible problem points among them, in such a way that we can move them all into each other and leave no gaps. It is quite tricky to show that you can take care of all the problem points at once, but it turns out that you can.

Notice that our trick requires that there be only countably many potential problem points, but that is so.

#Options [section_options]

Let us concentrate on volume, just to fix ideas, though something similar to what I’m about to say is true for length, area, and other properties. 

In the Banach-Tarski construction, a finite number of pieces put together one way have volume 1, put together another away have volume 2. There are a limited number of ways you can respond to this result. In fact, you must accept at least one of the following theses:

1. Rotations and translations change volume.
2. Volume is not additive.
3. Some sets of points do not have volumes.
4. The Axiom of Choice is false.

Why option 1? To put together the second sphere, we need to move pieces of the first sphere around. If the volume of the pieces change when they move, then that can explain why the volume of the pieces added up equals 1 in their original position, but, after moving things around, the volume of the pieces adds up to 2.

To take this option is to deny that the Lebesgue measure, or any other uniform measure, is the right measure for volume. Volume is no uniform, on this view; sometimes ways of moving objects around change their volume. 

Why option 2? If you sum the volumes of the pieces in the Banach-Tarski construction, you cannot get both the numbers one and two. But if volume is not additive, then that’s ok, because the volume of the two spheres need not equal the sum of the volume of the pieces (nor need the volume of the one sphere).

Note that it is not enough to deny that volume is *countably* additive. That would get you out of problems when it comes to length and area. But when it comes to volume, or any analogue for higher dimensions, finite additivity is too much. We can see that from the Banach-Tarski theorem; to make the Banach-Tarski situation coherent, it needs to be that the volume union of *five* pieces is not equal to the volume of each piece added together.

To take this option is to deny that *any* measure is the right way to model volume. We should use some other function that isn’t finitely additive. Volume is not finitely additive, on this view; sometimes, when you put some things together, the thing you make is bigger than the size of the pieces added together.

Why option 3? If the pieces involved in the Banach-Tarski construction have *no volume at all*, then there is no contradiction involved in saying that the volume of all the pieces put together one way is 1, and the volume of the pieces put together another way is 2. The volume of the pieces put together does not depend in any way on the volume of the pieces, in such cases, as the pieces have no volume.

Note that this is different from saying that the volume of the pieces is 0. That would not solve the problem. It’s rather that the volume of the pieces is just undefined.

This is the standard option. The standard option is to say that the Lebesgue measure is the correct measure for volume, and it is true that not every subset of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) has a well-defined volume. This means you have to accept that, sometimes, when you cut up something with volume, none of the pieces have the property of having a volume.

Why option 4? You cannot prove the Banach-Tarski theorem, or, more generally, that there are non-Lebesgue-measurable sets, without the Axiom of Choice. Deny the axiom of choice, then you deny the Banach-Tarski theorem, which is a consequence.

This is the option to take if you cannot believe the conclusion of the Banach-Tarski theorem. This is the only option that involves denying that result.

Mathematicians don’t in general, want to take this option, because they like the Axiom of Choice. It is equivalent to some important theorems in topology and real analysis. And you need it to prove that, for any two sets, the cardinality of one is either greater than, equal to, or less than the other. That is hard to give up!

Also, it is hard to understand how denying the Axiom of Choice helps in this case. That part of the proof that requires the Axiom of Choice is the part where you choose a centre for each of the Cayley graphs on the surface of the sphere. Now, those points are there, whether you choose them or not. So what are we saying, exactly, if we say that they don’t form a set, and for that reason we can’t use them in our proof? That *sounds* like we’re saying something about *us*, and what we can do, rather than saying something about the points themselves.

On the other hand, the Axiom of Choice has many weird consequences. The Banach-Tarski theorem might be the weirdest, but there are others. For instance, the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to the the well-ordering theorem. The well-ordering theorem basically makes modern set theory possible, which is another reason to like the Axiom of Choice. But I find it hard to believe, personally, that every set can be well-ordered. The set of real numbers, for instance — I have no conception of how that could possibly be well-ordered.

Tricky!

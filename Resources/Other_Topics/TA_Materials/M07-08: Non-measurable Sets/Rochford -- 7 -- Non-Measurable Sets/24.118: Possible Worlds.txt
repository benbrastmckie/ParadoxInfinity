##Probabilities and Possible Worlds

## Possible Worlds

Recall our friend the *probability function*. Usually, we think of the domain of a probability function as the set of propositions. But you can also think of the domain of a probability function as the set of all subsets of *W*, the set of all *possible worlds*.

What is a possible world? That is actually quite a deep question, but for our purposes you can think of it this way: a possible world is a special kind of proposition. It is a proposition that specifies *everything* there is to specify about the universe. For *every* proposition, either it or its negation is entailed by a possible world. So according to one possible world, I have 100,000 hairs on my head; according to another one, I don’t — instead, I have 100,001 hairs on my head. According to one possible world, there will be a war on the Korean peninsula in the next fifty years; according to another one, there won’t. According to one possible world, Newtonian mechanics is true; according to another, it is not.

Exactly one possible world describes everything as it actually is; the rest get something wrong. There are many more ways of being wrong than being right.

Ok, so that’s possible worlds. Now, for every set of possible worlds, there’s a proposition — the proposition that is true according to each world. So the proposition that the democrats will in the 2016 election corresponds to the set of all worlds according to which the democrats will win the 2016 election. In some of those worlds, a democrat wins and it’s Hillary, in some a democrat wins and it’s Bernie; in some its Hillary and I have a 100,000 hairs on my head; in some it’s Hillary and I have 100,001 hairs on my head. Every possible world in which a democrat wins the 2016 election, whatever else happens, is in the set.

This correspondence between sets of worlds and propositions is the reason that we can think of the set of propositions as actually the set of all subsets of *W*, and why we can think of the domain of a probability function as the set of all subsets of *W*.

If you think of propositions this way, then you can think of \(\neg p\) — i.e., the negation of a proposition *p* — as just it’s compliment. That is, \(\neg p\) is the set of all worlds that *aren’t* in \(p\). And you can think of the disjunction of two propositions \(p\vee q\) as the *union* of \(p\) and \(q\). That is, \(p\vee q\) is the set of all worlds that are either in \(p\) or in \(q\).

That’s neat. Why do we care? Because if you think of a probability function as a function of sets of subsets of *W*, you can generalise

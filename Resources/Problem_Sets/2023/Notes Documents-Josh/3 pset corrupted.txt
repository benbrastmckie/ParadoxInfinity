A murky problem can be addressed in more or less thoughtful ways. Good answers will reveal that you've understood the complexity of the underlying terrain and that you've given the issue serious thought. Addressing a murky question requires that you be \emph{more} rigorous, rather than less, because it's easier to make a mistake.}}}

\begin{enumerate}


\item \question{Imagine an island on which everyone is either a knight or a knave. Knights only assert truths, knaves only assert falsehoods.  

For each of the scenarios below, determine whether one can settle the question of whether \(S_0\) a knight or a knave. If the answer is ``yes'', state whether $S_0$ is a knight or a knave; if the answer is ``no'', state the reason why.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  \question{Ten islanders, \(S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_{9}\), are lined up. \(S_0\) is at the back of the line; in front of her is \(S_1\); in front of him is \(S_2\); and so on. Each islander says: ``There is at least one person in front of me, and everyone in front of me is a knave.''  (5~points)}

\answer{  \(S_0\) is a knave. We know that \(S_9\) doesn't have anyone in front of her. So, \(S_9\) is lying---so \(S_9\) is a knave. So \(S_8\) speaks truly when he says, ``There is at least one person in front of me, and everyone in front of me is a knave." Since \(S_8\) is telling the truth, \(S_8\) must be a knight. But then we know that everyone else---\(S_7\), \(S_6\), \dots and \(S_0\)---are lying when they say ``There is at least one person in front of me, and everyone in front of me is a knave," since in front of all of them is one person who isn't a knave. Since \(S_0\) is lying, \(S_0\) is a knave.  }


  
  
 
\item   \question{An $\omega$-sequence of islanders,  \(S_0, S_1, S_2, \ldots\), are lined up.  \(S_0\) is still at the back of the line; in front of her is \(S_1\); in front of him is \(S_2\), and so on. Each islander says: 
``There is at least one person in front of me, and everyone in front of me is a knave.''  (5 points)}

\answer{There is no coherent assignment of knight or knave status to \(S_0\). This problem is just Yablo's Paradox in disguise: it's just that we have island inhabitants instead of sentences.
      To see that no coherent assignment of knight or knave status is possible for \(S_0\), we will proceed by \emph{reductio}. We will first consider the assumption that \(S_0\) is a knight, and show that it leads to contradiction. We will then consider the assumption that \(S_0\) is a knave, and show that it too leads to contradiction.
      Suppose, first, that \(S_0\) is a knight. Then what she says is true. So it is true that there is at least one person in front of \(S_0\), and that everyone in front of her is a knave. That means, in particular, that \(S_1\) is a knave. So everything \(S_1\) says is false. So it is false that there is at least one person in front of \(S_1\) and that everyone in front of \(S_1\) is a knave. But since there are, in fact, people in front of \(S_1\), the only way for this to be false is for there to be some knight in front of \(S_0\), which contradicts the hypothesis that everything \(S_0\) says is true.
      Now suppose that \(S_0\) is a knave. Then what she says is false. So it is false that there is at least one person in front of \(S_0\) and that everyone in front of \(S_0\) is a knave. Since there are, in fact, people in front of \(S_0\), the only way for this to be false is for there to be some knight in front of \(S_0\). Say that that knight is \(S_k\). The same reasoning we used above to show that \(S_0\) cannot be a knight can be used to show that \(S_k\) cannot be a knight.
}
  
  

\item \question{As in the previous case, but this time each islander says: ``There is at least one person in front of me, and everyone in front of me is a knight.'' (5 points)}

\answer{It is consistent with the description of the problem that \(S_0\) be a knight, and consistent with the problem that \(S_0\) be a knave. 

It is consistent with the problem that everyone be a knight (and therefore that \(S_0\) be a knight). To see this, suppose that everyone is, indeed, a knight. Then for, any \(S_k\), it is true that there is at least one person in front of \(S_k\), and that everyone in front of \(S_k\) is a knight. So what \(S_k\) says is true. So \(S_k\) is indeed a knight. This means that our hypothesis that everyone is a knight is consistent with the description of the problem
 
 It is also consistent with the problem that everyone be a knave (and therefore that \(S_0\) be a knave). To see this, suppose that everyone is, indeed, a knave. Then for, any \(S_k\), it is false that everyone in front of \(S_k\) is a knight (and therefore false that there is at least one person in front of \(S_k\), \emph{and} that everyone in front of \(S_k\) is a knight). So what \(S_k\) says is false. So \(S_k\) is indeed a knave. This means that our hypothesis that everyone is a knave is consistent with the description of the problem}

\item \question{The following questions are intended to test your understanding of continuity assumptions. They may or may not have determinate answers. (If you think a question has a determinate answer, make sure you explain why. If you think it doesn't, make sure you explain why not.)}%\footnote{Rayo was told that the underlying puzzle was created by Frank Arntzenius's daughter, when she was very little.}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \question{
	You have a wheel with a radius of 1 unit. You draw a red line going from the center of the wheel to the twelve o'clock position:
	
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.2]{base}
\end{center}
	
	 You then rotate the wheel, in steps. At each step, you rotate the wheel one radian clockwise, so that the outermost point of the red line travels 1 unit around the perimeter of the wheel. Here is the first rotation:
	
	\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.2]{base}  \raisebox{13mm}{$\longrightarrow$} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{1rad}
\end{center}
Because the tip of the red line travels 1 unit around the perimeter after each rotation, and because the perimeter of the wheel is $2\pi$ units (which is an irrational number of units), there is no positive integer $n$ such that, after $n$ steps, the red line returns to a position it had occupied before.

Suppose you perform this operation infinitely many times, once for each positive integer. At noon the red line is at the twelve o'clock position. At 12:30 you rotate the wheel one radian clockwise. At 12:45 you rotate the wheel another radian clockwise. And so forth: for each $n \geq 1$, you perform the $n$th rotation $\frac{1}{2^n}$ hours before 1pm.

Question: in which direction will the red line be pointing at 1pm? (10 points)}

\answer{The answer is not determined by the description of the problem.}

\item \question{Suppose you start by drawing lines on the wheel as in part (b). But this time you perform no rotations. Instead, you \emph{erase} red lines using the following procedure. At 1:00pm you erase the red line pointing to the twelve o'clock position. At 1:30 you erase the line pointing one radian in the clockwise direction from the last line erased. And so forth: for each $n \geq 1$, you erase the line one radian away in the clockwise direction from the last line erased.

Question: Is there a difference between the way our wheel looks at 2pm and the way the wheel in the previous exercise looked at 2pm? Assume that the only way for an erased line to reappear is for someone to redraw it. (5~points)}

\answer{Yes, there is a difference. In the case in which you erase lines, the wheel will be completely unmarked at 2pm.}

\item \question{
Consider a variant of the case in part (a). As before, you start by drawing a red line from the center of the wheel to the twelve o'clock position. But this time you draw new lines, in steps. At each step, you draw a red line at a one radian angle from the last line you drew. At noon you draw the initial red line, pointing to the twelve o'clock position. At 12:30 you draw an additional line, a radian away in the clockwise direction. At 12:45 you draw an additional line, a radian away in the clockwise direction. And so forth: for each $n \geq 1$, you draw a line $\frac{1}{2^n}$ hours before 1pm. Here are the first two steps of the process:


	\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.2]{base}  \raisebox{13mm}{$\longrightarrow$} \includegraphics[scale=.2]{2rad}
\end{center}



At 1pm, you're done drawing lines on the wheel. Note that there's a well-defined fact of the matter about what the wheel is like. Namely: a radial line $r$ will be colored red if and only if, for some number $n$, $r$ is exactly $n$ radians away from twelve o'clock, going clockwise.


The next step is to rotate the wheel. Consider the result of rotating the wheel one radian in the clockwise direction. It'll look exactly the way the unrotated wheel would have looked  if you had skipped drawing the 12pm line. And if you rotate the wheel one radian further, for a total rotation of two radians,  it'll look exactly the way the unrotated wheel would have looked  if you had skipped drawing the 12pm and 12:30pm lines. And so forth: after a total of $n$ rotations, the wheel will look exactly the way the original unrotated wheel would have looked  if you had skipped drawing all lines up to and including the 1pm$-\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ hours line.

Suppose that you rotate the wheel infinitely many times, once for each positive integer. At 1pm you rotate the wheel one radian in the clockwise direction. At 1:30 you rotate the wheel another radian in the clockwise direction. Again at 1:45. And so forth. For each $n \geq 0$, you perform the $n$th rotation $\frac{1}{2^n}$ hours before 2:00pm. 

Question: What does the wheel look like at 2pm? Assume that the only way for a line to disappear is for someone to erase it. (10 points)
}


\answer{One excellent answer is to say that the wheel looks exactly the way it did before you started rotating. (Some students might add that the description of the problem doesn't settle the wheel's orientation, but failure to do so shouldn't be penalized.)}

		\answer{You will have no money at midnight. To see this, suppose otherwise.  Then you are left with one or more bills at midnight. Let $k$ be the serial number of one of them.

They proceed in inverse order, with $a_0$ choosing last, $a_1$ next to last, and so forth. Choices are made on the following schedule:

\end{description}
Assume that every member of the team succeeds in following this strategy. As a result, they either all choose 1 or all choose 0. Is there a \emph{causal explanation}\footnote{What is a causal explanation? To causally explain why $x$ occurred rather than $y$ is to describe a sequence of causes and effects leading to $x$ in a way that makes clear why $x$ came about rather than $y$.} to be given about why the group chooses one rather than zero (or zero rather than one)? If so, spell out the explanation in some detail. If not, explain why not. (10~points)


}

\answer{Either answer is potentially fine, as long as it is properly justified and displays some appreciation for the underlying issues. My expectation, however, is that most reasonable answers will claim that there is no {causal} explanation to be given: the group's choice is just a brute fact about the world. 

Here is one way of justifying this claim. Assume (with no loss of generality) that the group chooses 0. For each $k$, $a_k$ chose 0 because $a_{k+1}$ chose 0, which happened because $a_{k+2}$ chose 0, which happened because \dots. There are, of course, further events that causally affect the outcome. (For instance, the team's deciding to play the game, or deciding to follow Team A's Strategy.) But none of these further events plays any role in explaining why the group chose 0 \emph{rather than 1}. The events that explain why the group chose 0 rather than 1 all occur at times later than 11am. But at any such time, the issue of whether the group chooses 0 or 1 has been fully decided. So there is no time such that: (a) an event at that time can be part of a causal explanation of why the group chose 0 rather than 1, and (b) the issue has not been fully decided by that time.

Each team consists of an $\omega$-sequence of persons: $a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots$ and $b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots$, respectively. Between 11:00am and noon, the members of Team A and Team B will take turns choosing ones and zeroes. They proceed in inverse order, with $a_0$ and $b_0$ choosing last, $a_1$ and $b_1$ choosing next to last, and so forth. In addition, $a_k$ always chooses ahead of $b_k$. Choices are made on the following schedule:

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The two teams have opposing goals: Team A wants $a_k$ and $b_k$ to choose the same, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Team B wants them to choose differently,

Since Team B has the advantage of choosing second, they agree on the following strategy:

\begin{description}
\item[Team B's Strategy]
If $a_k$ chooses 0, $b_k$ chooses 1; otherwise, $b_k$ chooses 0. 

\end{description}
Team A knows about Bacon's Puzzle. First, they partition the set of $\omega$-sequences of 0s and 1s by placing two sequences in the same cell if and only if the sequences differ at most finitely (i.e.~there are at most finitely many $i \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the sequences differ on the $i$th position). Then they agree on a representative from each cell.

Now suppose it is $a_k$'s turn to choose and let $B$ be the sequence $\seq{c(b_0),c(b_1),c(b_2),\dots}$, where $c(b_i)$ is the choice that $b_i$ has in fact made (or will in fact make). Since $b_0, \dots, b_{k}$ have not made their choices yet, $a_k$ doesn't know what they are. But we will suppose that $a_k$ knows what $b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, \dots$'s choices are. Accordingly, $a_k$ knows what lies in all but finitely many positions of the sequence $B$. This is enough to ascertain which cell $B$ is in, and therefore to identify $\rho_B$, which is the sequence that had been previously been agreed upon as a representative for $B$'s cell. $a_k$ is then asked to choose as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Team A's Strategy]
If the sequence $\rho_B$ has a 0 in its $k$th position, $a_k$ chooses 0; otherwise, $a_k$ chooses 1.

\item \question{By assuming that every member of Team A succeeds in following Team A's Strategy, show that there are at most finitely many $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a_k$ and $b_k$ choose differently. (5 points)}

\answer{$\rho_B$ and $B$ differ in at most finitely many positions. When every member of Team A follows their strategy, this means that $\seq{c(a_0),c(a_1),c(a_2),\dots}$ and $\seq{c(b_0),c(b_1),c(b_2),\dots}$ differ in at most finitely many positions, and therefore that $a_k$ will pick like $b_k$ for all but at most finitely many $k$.}


\item \question{It is obvious that if every member of Team B succeeds in following Team B's Strategy, $a_k$ and $b_k$ will choose differently for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$. So it follows form part (a) that it is impossible for every member of Team A to succeed in following Team A's strategy and every member of Team B to succeed in following Team B's strategy. 

Does the setup of the problem settle the question of who will fail to follow their assigned strategy? Does it determine a causal mechanism that might explain why people who don't follow their assigned strategy fail to do so? (10~points)

}

\answer{The description of the problem does not settle an answer to the question of who will fail to follow their assigned strategy. One can consistently fill out the details by claiming that Team A succeeds in following their strategy and Team B does not, or the other way around. 

The description of the problem also fails to determine a causal mechanism that might explain why the people who don't follow their strategy fail to do so. (Maybe $b_k$ looses heart when he sees that infinitely many people ahead of him have failed to follow Team B's strategy. Maybe $a_k$ makes a mistake in identifying $\rho(B)$, or steps on a banana peel on her way in\dots)

Some students might be tempted to say that people who do not follow their assigned strategy fail to do so because \emph{logic} prevents them from doing so. Without further elaboration, such an answer should not get full credit, since it is not clear how logic plays a role in the causal mechanism that explains why the people who don't follow the strategy fail to do so.

\item \question{

There are two prisoners in a room. They both close their eyes and each of
them is approached by a guard. Each guard flips a fair coin. If the coin lands Heads, she
gives her prisoner a red hat; if it lands Tails, she gives her prisoner a blue hat.
Once the prisoners have been assigned hats, they are both allowed to open their eyes.

As soon as they each see the color of the other's hat (but not the color of their own hat), the prisoners are taken into separate rooms and are unable to communicate with one another. At that point, they are each asked to name the color of their hat. The prisoners must answer.
\begin{itemize}
\item if at least one of the prisoners answers correctly, they will both be set free;
\item otherwise, they will both be shot.

that they both survive.  Make sure your strategy is \emph{deterministic}: it must determine a definite outcome for each prisoner, given the prisoner's situation at the time of his decision. (5 points)}

\answer{Here's a strategy that guarantees success: Prisoner 1 picks the color of the other prisoner's hat; Prisoner 2 picks the color opposite to that of the other prisoner's hat.}

\item \question{Given that the prisoners have no access to information about the color of their own hats, and that the colors were chosen using independent coin tosses, what explains the possibility of a deterministic strategy that brings the prisoners' chance of survival above 50\%? (5 points)}

\answer{The probability that a given prisoner answers correctly is no better than 50\%. (In fact, it is exactly 50\%.) But the strategy above guarantees that the prisoners' answers are \emph{coordinated}, so that one of them is right if and only if the other one is wrong. That's why the group's probability of success can go up to 1 even if the probability that each prisoner answers correctly is stuck at 50\%.}

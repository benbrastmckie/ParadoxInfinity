to save time, try to make minimal changes to andreas version from last year!

perhaps I can move some more to auto-grading? 

could also code up indicative vs. conditionals practice problem 

could also code up the first practice problem, or save for in-class?

another idea: look at Joyce problem sets from 443. must be some good questions. perhaps email elise for this stuff? or check dropbox.

possibly also from brian's class 444? 

Andreas version currently at 70 points. has a lot for the TAs to grade perhaps...


risk of automating expected value problems is high risk of foolish mistake...and wouldn't be able to give partial for people showing their work...

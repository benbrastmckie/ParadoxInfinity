## Module 1: Cantor's Paradise

- Week 1: Infinite Cardinalities
  - OBP, Ch.1
    -

## Module 2: Paradox in Paradise

- Week 4: Russell's Paradox
  - Intro thought: solution to Zeno suggests optimism
    - Perhaps the paradoxes are only due to underdevelopment of the concepts used to express the paradox?
    - There may be much to learn
  - Russell's contradiction is a derivative of Cantor's
    - See "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy" (p.136) Russell
    - See Sec. 1.4 in SEP "self-reference" for clear exposition
  - Compare to Barbar paradox?
    - Quine "The ways of paradox" (p.14)
    - Salmon "A note on Kripke's Paradox..."
- Week 5
  - Self-Reference
    - VCP Russell's diagnosis in "Principia Mathematica" (p.37)
    - RTT as solution given in "Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types"
  - Problems for RTT
    - Separates reals into orders "Mathematics and Logic" Weyl (1946)
    - Axiom of Reducibility as answer, but unintuitive
- Week 6
  - Intro thought: Russell proposes RTT to solve all paradoxes
    - But independently we also want a consistent foundation for mathematics
    - Want the notion of set to be intuitive while serving the needs of mathematics
  - Set theory
    - Zermelo shows that the paradoxes are avoided in Z (p.197, 1908)
      - But there can't be a set of everything
    - "The iterative conception of set" Boolos (1971)
- Week 7
  - Absolute Generality
    - No set of everything, but equally, can't seem to quantify over everything
    - "Speaking of Everything" Cartwright

- Paradox in Paradise
  - Week 4: Russell's Paradox
    - Intro thought: solution to Zeno suggests optimism
      - Perhaps the paradoxes are only due to underdevelopment of the concepts used to express the paradox?
      - There may be much to learn
    - Russell's contradiction is a derivative of Cantor's
      - See "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy" (p.136) Russell
      - See Sec. 1.4 in SEP "self-reference" for clear exposition
    - Compare to Barbar paradox?
      - Quine "The ways of paradox" (p.14)
      - Salmon "A note on Kripke's Paradox..."
  - Week 5
    - Self-Reference
      - VCP Russell's diagnosis in "Principia Mathematica" (p.37)
      - RTT as solution given in "Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types"
    - Problems for RTT
      - Separates reals into orders "Mathematics and Logic" Weyl (1946)
      - Axiom of Reducibility as answer, but unintuitive
  - Week 6 - Intro thought: Russell proposes RTT to solve all paradoxes - But independently we also want a consistent foundation for mathematics - Want the notion of set to be intuitive while serving the needs of mathematics - Set theory - Zermelo shows that the paradoxes are avoided in Z (p.197, 1908) - But there can't be a set of everything
    - "The iterative conception of set" Boolos (1971)

      <!--     - Absolute Generality -->
      <!--         - No set of everything, but equally, can't seem to quantify over everything -->

Paradox and infinity - Ben
Note: The exact details of how it’ll go are still undecided.
In an attempt to make the class more philosophically-oriented, there will be three short papers, and reduced problem sets compared to the past. We will skip sections on the Banach-Tarski theorem, computability, and incompleteness in order to expand on the time paradoxes, Newcomb's paradox, and possibly new sections on absolute generality and the liar’s paradox.

TAs will be expected to attend lectures, hold weekly discussion sections, grade problem sets and papers, and hold one office hour a week. I will provide example solutions for the problem sets to make grading faster and easier to standardize. There will also be an opportunity to lecture, though no obligation to do so. I am happy to write reports if TAs do decide to lecture on a topic.

The grading structure will be something like:
9 short problem sets (5% each, dropping the lowest)
3 short papers (10% each)
3 in class pop quizzes (5% each)
Section participation (15%)
The papers topics might include:
Time Travel
Newcomb's Paradox
Absolute Generality
The Liar Paradox
I will assign supplementary readings in addition to Agustin’s book “On the Brink of Paradox” in order to expand selected topics covered in the book and help students prepare their papers.

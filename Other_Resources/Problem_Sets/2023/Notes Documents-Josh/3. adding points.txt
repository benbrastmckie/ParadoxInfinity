trying to figure out point assignments for PSet 3:

9 subproblems, so need to average 11 points per problem. so aim for some at 12--16 others at 6--10
haha wrong: 10 subproblems! 

10, 14, 12
10
8, 8, 12
10
8
12
This hits 104, so need to shave off four points

10, 10, 10
10
10, 10, 10
10
10, 10


10, 14, 10
8
10, 10, 10
10
8, 10

need to apportion 10 points, so 4, 4, 2:

10, 14, 14
10
10, 12, 10
8, 12

running Universal machine on g simulates running G on empty. 


Altering point scheme:
need 68 points in part 2

3a b c to 6 points each

4a, b to 6 points each, c to 10 points (?), 

so have now added 3+2+5 = 10 points 

or all three to 8 points? 

then would have added 3+9 = 12 points 

reduce #5 from 18points to 

10 points?

reduce #6 from 20 points to 16 or 15 (so people could bail on this one w/ the eval incentivie)

checking math: 18 + 24 + 10 + 16 = 68 points

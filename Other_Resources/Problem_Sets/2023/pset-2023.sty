\noindent 
Please ensure that your submission is prepared for blind review. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \underline{Do not} include your name on problem set submissions. If so inclined by the whims of paranoia, include your {MIT ID} instead.
    
    \item List your collaborators \underline{on the LAST page} of your pset, preferably a separate page so that no one sees it till the end. \emph{Failing to list collaborators constitutes a violation of academic integrity}.
    
   %  \underline{Do not} list your collaborators on  problem set submissions. Instead, make sure you list any collaborators using the ``comment'' box on Canvas when you submit your problem set. 
\end{itemize}

How your answers will be graded:

\begin{itemize} 

\item In Part I there is no need to justify your answers. Submit answers via \textbf{CANVAS QUIZ}!!!!

\item In Part~II you must justify your answers. Assessment will be based both on whether you give the correct answer and on how your answers are {justified}. (In some problem sets I will ask you to answer questions that don't have clear answers. In those cases, assessment will be based entirely on your justification. Even if it is unclear whether your answer is correct, it should be clear whether or not the reasons you have given in support of your answer are good ones.)

\item  \emph{No answer may comprise more than 180 English words}. Longer answers will be penalized. (Not to fear! Showing your work in a calculation or proof does \textit{not} count toward the word limit. \textit{Whew})


\item You may consult published literature and the web, but you must credit all sources. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism and can have serious consequences. For advice about when/how to credit sources see \url{https://integrity.mit.edu/}. (No need to credit course materials, but remember Hunt \& Philosophy if you ever become a hedgefund manager ;)

\end{itemize}

All submissions must be in PDF format. Type-written submissions may be strongly preferred by your TA; handwritten submissions are acceptable only if: 

\begin{enumerate} 
\item your handwriting is easily legible (as judged by your TA); 
\item you produce a clean version of the document (as opposed to the sheet of paper you used to work out the problems); and 
\item your manuscript has been scanned to high enough standards (as judged by your TA). Consider using, e.g.~\emph{Scannable} or \emph{Adobe Scan}.

\end{enumerate}

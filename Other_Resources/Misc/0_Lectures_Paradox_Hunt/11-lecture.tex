\subsection{2nd Incompleteness Theorem}

% % Note that to really set this up properly, I should note what Smith discusses on page 118 (without too many tears) at the start of section 17.4.
%what's really at issue is that we can't use a logically weaker theory to prove the consistency of a logically stronger theory, and that is a bummer. can't leap-frog confidence
%so there's a sense in which even w/out 2nd theorem we'd still have this upshot about certainty not being attainable
%for as Smith notes, an inconsistent theory can derive that it's consistent, and the inability to prove consistency is not evidence against consistency (for Con_T could be just another true godel sentence). 
%does this pose a problem for rayo's simple story?

\item[] -- We made a mistake/error in the proof
\item[] -- One of our starting assumptions is false

\item So even if we could avoid all errors in proofs, we can't become certain that sufficiently strong theories are consistent

\item So we can't become certain of many mathematical truths, even in the weaker sense that only requires consistency

% We can sometimes provide relative consistency proofs, wherein we prove that a set of axioms is consistent, relative to the assumption that some stronger set of axioms is consistent
% we can then be at least as confident in the weaker set of axioms as we are in the stronger set, if not more. Would we use Bayesian updating in our degree of confidence? I.e. take the relative consistency proof as a kind of evidence in favor of the weaker set of axioms?

% helpful gloss from page 307: ``standardly the descriptivist's truth conditions are propositions about some body of evidence, where this body of evidence includes the knowledge of the agent doing the believing" [307]

\item G. E. Moore: $\langle$\textit{it's possible that I'm not getting promoted}$\rangle$ means `It is not certain that I am' or `I don't know that I am'.

\item Stanley: $\langle$It is possible$_A$ that $p$$\rangle$ is true iff what $A$ knows does not---in a manner obvious to $A$---entail $\neg p$

\frametitle{Descriptivism about `Probably'}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Consider probability modals like `probably' and `it is likely that'

\item \emphz{Descriptivism}: these modals describe the speaker's epistemic state, e.g. their credences. 

\item To assert $\langle$It's probably sunny$\rangle$ means your credence in sunshine is greater than $0.5$ (or above some contextual threshold)
%where credences can be understood in terms of betting behavior
\item[] (credences can be understood in terms of dispositions to bet)
% e.g. Jeffrey quotation in Yalcin footnote 3: ``if you say the probability of rain is 70\% you are reporting that, all things considered, you would bet on rain at odds of $7:3$"

\item Alternative view: $\langle$It's probably sunny$\rangle$ means that relative to a particular probability measure $P$ and body of evidence, $P(\text{sunshine}) > \text{some contextually-determined threshold}$
% allegedly, a body of evidence can induce a probability measure
% the relevant body of evidence can be determined by the context, e.g. the context in which the sentence is uttered or assessed

\frametitle{Expressivism about Epistemic Modals}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Guiding question: what state(s) of mind do we express when we believe or say that something \textit{might} be the case \\ (or that something \textit{probably} is the case)?

% % Note that here, I seemingly deviate from Yalcin nonfactualism chapter. The view that he considers, which he calls the `first-order model' (taken from Frank Veltman) seems still descriptivist to me. Or else it involves a seemingly primitive notion of possibility (e.g. possible worlds), which seems partly what's in question here.
% p. 309: On the allegedly non-descriptivist model that Yalcin discusses, ``to believe Bob might be in his office is simply to be in a doxastic state which fails to rule out the possibility that Bob is in his office". So we don't explicitly mention possible-bob-in-office worlds. 
% On page 312, Yalcin claims that he is still committed to a (robust) ontology of possibilities, e.g. possible worlds. Yet Thomasson describes how `possiblility' talk is a modal nominalization from `it is possible' talk. which is a modal adjectival form of `might' talk. 

\item \emph{Expressivism}: to judge that $\langle$it is possibly sunny$\rangle$ is to express an attitude of \textit{being for not ruling out that it is sunny}. 

\item[] -- It says something like ``Don't be certain that it's not sunny!"

%\item[] -- Or, ``don't take me to know that it's not sunny"! 

% Helpful gloss from Bennett 2003, p. 90 (cited by smoss 2013): the speaker ``is not assuring me that her value for a certain conditional probability is high, but is assuring me of that high-value. \dots She aims to convince me of that probability, not the proposition that it is her probability" [quoted on p. 4] 

\item Epistemic modals help us coordinate on which states of affairs to leave open, to consider as live options

% So expressivism about probability or credences might be something like the following: being for being this confident! Accepting a set of norms that recommend this degree of confidence (perhaps given a particular body of evidence)

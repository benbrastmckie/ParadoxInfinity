%final things to do for tuesday 4-18 lecture:
%incorporate various positions/responses to banach--tarski that maddy ch. 1 discusses!
%try to get some clarity on weakenings of axiom of choice and what they let us still achieve
%possibly refresh on skolem paradox? or save for later? 
%could look into formalism and how hilbert used this to feel okay and perhaps even vindicate the axiom of choice: a rule we can use in a game. and idea i had that games can have glitches, and that's okay! 

% It seems like perhaps I and Agustin have been misspeaking when we say that the axiom of choice is necessary to prove that there are non-measurable sets of real numbers. It seems that the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem is sufficient, and BPI is weaker than AC!
%from SEP page: ``There is a Lebesgue nonmeasurable set of real numbers (Vitali 1905). This was shown much later to be a consequence of BPI (see below) and hence weaker than AC. Solovay (1970) established its independence of the remaining axioms of set theory."

% Seems that Solovay's model relies on the assumption that there exists an inaccessible cardinal (and that its existence is consistent with ZFC). So we might have some qualms about that as well! Could be neat to do an excursion into inaccessible Cardinals
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovay_model

% one thing to possibly discuss on lecture day 3 of this unit: given that the axiom of choice leads to puzzles, and also that the axiom of choice is equivalent to every vector space having a basis (which is a physically fruitful instance of mathematics, i.e. has important applications to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory), should we be concerned that our best physical theories will also inherit some of the paradoxes from axiom of choice?
% One possible response: even if a physical theory inherited such a paradox, we would have to view this as a limitation of our model, rather than a paradoxical result about physical reality.
% E.g., the Banach--tarski theorem is not modeling physical spheres. Something can be logically possible or mathematically possible without being physically possible (or even physically meaningful)

% finitism would be one restriction attitude: only use the axiom of choice in finite cases
% constructivism: only use the axiom of choice where we can actually construct a choice set explicitly, e.g. using something like Separation Axiom 
% but I still need to investigate sense in which a constructive mathematician like Bishop is happy to use axiom of choice.

%formalism: One thing that I should probably comment on/discuss in class: insofar as Hilbert was super happy with axiom of choice and Hilbert was also a proponent of formalism, presumably formalism is one non-Platonist way of vindicating the axiom of choice: we view this as just another move in our formal game. No problem with a game if it sometimes has `glitches': this is to be expected perhaps. We don't expect game rules to work perfectly all the time. 

%gameplan: tuesday: cover borel sets and brief connection b/w axiom of choice and non-measurable sets
%Thursday: then recap attitudes we can take toward math (from day 0), and do Bacon's puzzle and interpretative upshots in relation to axiom of choice
%next tuesday: then continue this w/ banach--tarski, discuss various options P Maddy provides, in contrast w/ Wildberger attitude
%next Thursday: then finish w/ discussion of rationality and various views on probability; apply the rationality stuff to AC
%try to get in smoss and yalcin stuff, at least their glosses---holding off till Last Lecture day, topic 11 for this

%could run these slides together w/ Topic 8 slides: goal is to cover basics needed for psets and then kill time w/ backlog of fun topics/excursions! 

%would be nice to expand in detail on what we lose if we give up on the AoC. I recall downloading a book that discussed AoC and its uses in detail. try to find that! maybe the Jech Axiom of choice book?
%also the history book by Moore 

%possible excursion topics:
%could also get into the law of nature stuff this week! or save for probability! or even for the last day of class. 
%free will
%causal explN background: e.g. woodward view (could be relevant for time-travel stuff, so could also save for later)
%rationality: straightforwardly factual vs. normative/plan-laden; defs relevant for decision theory unit! and whether dominance reasoning is rational. 

%stuff on axiom of choice: relevant for bacon's puzzle
%could also save bacon puzzle for AoC unit! or return to later 
%could couple w/ Yablo's extension case, where the strategy to Bacon's paradox seems to lead to a genuine contradiction!!! see my notes in 3-thoughts and also the slides he sent me. Bevs vs. Owls 


% could incorporate/do if needing to kill time:
% chalk and talk the review sheet for this week

\item Call such closed intervals ``line segments''

\item Intuitively, the Length$\left([a,b]\right) = b - a$.
\end{itemize}

\item We'd like to generalize this notion of length to sets such as the open interval $(a, b)$, the point $\{ a \}$, $[a, b)$, and unions of all of these sets, e.g. $[a, b] \cup [c, d]$ for $a < b< c < d \in \mathbb{R}$

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

%\item You come home from math class one day and are super pumped to tell your parents, siblings, mailperson, and anyone willing to listen a MIND-BLOWING FACT: \textit{there are as many numbers in the interval} $[0, 1]$ \textit{as there are in the open interval} $(-\infty, \infty)$

\item Next year, you're chatting with a student who's only a couple weeks into this class. They tell you the following MIND-BLOWING FACT: \textit{there are as many numbers in the interval} $[0, 1]$ \textit{as there are in the interval} $(-\infty, \infty)$. 

\item Another student overhears this claim and remarks that mathematicians must have lost their god d$^{***}$ minds, since clearly $[0, 1]$ is a proper subset of  $(-\infty, \infty)$.

\item How are you disposed to respond to this pair of sizable remarks? 



% % Indignant, you respond, indeed, there are actually as many multiples of 100 as there are natural numbers!!!

%\item Presently, how are you disposed to respond to your interlocutor?


\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%Note that student 1 is presumably relying on these two intervals having the same cardinality, namely that of the continuum. But, as we discussed in Topic 1 (prompt 3), cardinality captures only one aspect of the intuitive notion of `size'

%natural response: although there is a bijection between the members of these two intervals, the latter interval has infinite Lebesgue measure and is in that sense a larger set. So Lebesgue measure adds another facet to our notion of size of sets.
%this is all the more reason to not identify cardinality with `size'.  

%But note that two sets can have the same Lebesgue measure while differing in cardinality. e.g. both the Naturals and the Cantor set have Lebesgue measure 0, but the cantor set is uncountable. 

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lebesgue Measure beyond Borel Measure}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Any function on the Borel Sets is a \textbf{measure} if and only if it satisfies Countable Additivity and Non-Negativity (and assigns the value 0 to the empty set).\label{gloss:measure} 

\item The \emph{Lebesgue Measure} is the (unique) measure $\lambda$ that satisfies Length on Segments

\item Note that even some non-Borel sets have Lebesgue measure: 

\bi

\item In general, we say that a set  $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is \textbf{Lebesgue Measurable} if and only if $A = A^B \cup A^0$, for $A^B$  a Borel Set and $A^0$ a subset of some Borel Set of Lebesgue Measure zero.

\item We apply $\lambda$ to Lebesgue measurable sets that are not Borel sets by stipulating that  $\lambda(A^B \cup A^0) = \lambda(A^B)$. 
\ei

%note that the Vitali sets are not borel sets. To see this, note that every Borel set has Lebesgue measure. But the Vitali sets lack Lebesgue measure, so they must not be Borel sets! 

%so in particular, note that there are uncountable Borel sets of Lebesgue Measure 0 that have subsets that are NOT Borel sets. 
%the Cantor set is an uncountable set of Lebesgue Measure 0 (but it is still Borel); see p. 185 of paradox book. 
%so cantor set has non-borel subsets

%see here for discussion of cantor set: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1120032/is-any-subset-of-the-cantor-set-a-borel-set

%``the same reasoning shows that any subset of R that has the same cardinality as R (for instance, any non-degenerate interval) contains non-Borel subsets. In particular, there are non-Borel subsets of R''
%argument: there are continuum many borel sets of reals, but the subsets of the reals is powerset of the continuum. so there must be `more' subsets of reals than the borel sets. 

%neat connection with the axiom of choice: ``At any rate, note that the axiom of choice—or its equivalent variants like the well-ordering theorem invoked in transfinite induction—is crucial for all of these results. Indeed, the possibility that all subsets of R are Borel is logically consistent with the negation of the axiom of choice.''
%so if we deny the AC, then it is possible that every subset of R IS a borel set. this is presumably related to the fact that we need the AC to construct non-measurable sets, e.g. the Vitali sets. 

%a faster argument for the cantor set being a borel set: the cantor set is closed!

\frametitle{Non-Measurable Sets and the Axiom of Choice}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emphz{Axiom of Choice}: Every set $A$ of non-empty, non-overlapping sets has a \textbf{choice set} (i.e. a set that contains exactly one member from each member of $A$)

%\item[] A \textbf{choice set} for set $A$ is a set that contains exactly one member from each member of $A$

\item Assuming the AC, we can prove there are sets that lack Lebesgue measure (e.g. Vitali sets)

\item Since every Borel set has Lebesgue measure, these non-measurable sets are not Borel

\item Note that if we deny AC, then we can consistently take every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ to be Borel 
%(in particular, the reals would be a countable union of countable sets)
%note that although this latter remark sounds like it would entail that the reals are countable if we deny AC, it actually does not!  ``The reals are still uncountable, and François' construction gives a |R|-sized Q -independent subset. The trick is that without AC, “countable union of countable sets” doesn't imply countable!''

\item Remains the case that each prisoner individually has only a 50\% chance of answering correctly (out of eight possibilities, they remain silent in four, answer correctly in two, \& incorrectly in two)

\item Somehow, following this strategy \textit{guarantees} that only finitely-many prisoners remain captive

\item What is the probability that any individual who follows this strategy correctly calls out their hat color?

\item[] \textit{1st argument}: only finitely-many people answer incorrectly, which seems to be a set of measure zero $\Rightarrow$ P(guess correctly) $=1$

\item[] \textit{2nd argument}: consider an arbitrary person $P_k$: she answers correctly if the `cut-off' $c$ between the actual sequence $s_@$ and $r(O_@)$ occurs at or before k, 
\item[] -- such that for all points after $c$, $s_@(n) = r(O_@)(n)$.

\item Equivalently: in the actual orbit $O_@$, what proportion of sequences describe my actual hat color? 

\item Issue: what if this set---containing the sequences that match my hat color---is not measurable? 
%moral: you can't assume that a set will be measurable. some well-defined sets are not measurable. so be careful! 

%upshot for the hat puzzle, from video lecture: ``What we want to know is, what is the probability that I will guess correctly given that I do use the strategy? That question is equivalent to the question of, what is the proportion of possible representatives in the cell that I know to be actual, that matches the actual color of my hat? And I claim that that is a non-measurable set."

%interpretation of non-measurable sets of interval, from video lecture: ``So the existence of non-measurable sets can be thought of as the observation that sometimes when you pick a subset of the line segment there is no fact of the matter about what proportion of points are in your set."

%Rayo's tidy moral in the last four minutes, which seems right to me: ``So what we've proved is that you can't take for granted that probabilities are well defined. So when you have a space and you know that a member of that space is going to be picked at random you can't assume that there's a well defined fact of the matter that what you pick is going to have a certain property."

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Choice point: \textit{what attitude to take} toward the AC?

\item \emph{Vindication}: AC is indispensable for modern mathematics; relying on it is rational; nothing to fear! 
%interesting to think how formalists, logicists, structuralists, platonists might all differ in their attitudes of vindication toward AC
%e.g. logicists might vindicate it only if AC is viewed as principle of logic?

\item \emph{Meh}: we tolerate the AC, but we're disturbed by its counter-intuitive consequences
%\item[] Avoid using AC as much as possible
%e.g. fictionalism or quietism
%we should avoid using the AC as much as possible, and 

\item \emph{Restriction}: \textit{only some} uses of the AC are rationally permissible, e.g. when it leads to results that are fruitful in science 
%this would be a kind of naturalism about mathematics

%response: but we'll always have seen infinitely-many Nasty calls, with only finitely-many left. and that's enough to determine the orbit! so the orbit is determined even if the calls are not, and that seems to be enough for the Nice's strategy to succeed! their pre-selected representative will by defN disagree w/ the actual sequence of Nasty calls at only finitely-many places

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emphz{Axiom of Choice} (AC): Every set $A$ of non-empty, non-overlapping sets has a \textbf{choice set} 
\item[] (a set that contains exactly one member from each member of $A$)

\item Last time, we applied the AC to choose a representative from each orbit in an uncountable set of orbits

\item The AC is useful whenever we fail to know a general property that we could specify in order to select a representative

% presumably, there is no general property we could specify in order to select a representative. E.g. we can't use the separation principle. I guess they technically prove this in their problem set.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A Choiceworthy Timeline}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item[1904:] Zermelo introduces AC in order to prove the Well-ordering theorem: every set can be well-ordered
%recall defN of well-ordering: ``a well-order (or well-ordering or well-order relation) on a set S is a total order on S with the property that every non-empty subset of S has a least element in this ordering. "
%and recall that a total order is a partial order where every element is comparable (i.e. either less than equal to or greater than). partial order requires reflexive, transitive, and anti-symmetric (i.e. if a is distinct from b, then one of them is greater than the other)
% interesting that this result ends up being logically equivalent to axiom of choice!
%``Zermelo’s original purpose in introducing AC was to establish a central principle of Cantor’s set theory, namely, that every set admits a well-ordering and so can also be assigned a cardinal number. Zermelo’s 1904 introduction of the axiom, as well as the use to which he put it, provoked considerable criticism from the mathematicians of the day. The chief objection raised was to what some saw as its highly non-constructive, even idealist, character"

\item[1905:] Vitali constructs non-measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$

\item[1908:] Zermelo reformulates AC to respond to constructivist critics, and presents axioms for set theory 
%``Zermelo’s response to his critics came in the form in two papers in 1908. In the first of these, as remarked above, he reformulated AC in terms of transversals; in the second (1908a) he made explicit the further assumptions needed to carry through his proof of the well-ordering theorem. These assumptions constituted the first explicit presentation of an axiom system for set theory."

%\item[1914:] Hausdorff uses AC to derive non-measurable sets

\item[1924:] Banach and Tarski prove that AC entails highly counter-intuitive result about solid spheres
%``(Banach and Tarski 1924): any solid sphere can be split into finitely many pieces which can be reassembled to form two solid spheres of the same size; and any solid sphere can be split into finitely many pieces in such a way as to enable them to be reassembled to form a solid sphere of arbitrary size. (See Wagon 1993.)"

%1926: ``	Hilbert introduces into his proof theory the “transfinite” or “epsilon” axiom as a version of AC . (Hilbert 1926)." so again, Hilbert must have thought AC is no issue for formalism!!! 

\item[1935:] Zorn publishes his namesake lemma, although Hamburg proved it earlier
%``Max Zorn, apparently unacquainted with previous formulations of maximal principles, publishes (Zorn 1935) his definitive version thereof later to become celebrated as his lemma (ZL). ZL was first formulated in Hamburg in 1933, where Chevalley and Artin quickly “adopted” it. It seems to have been Artin who first recognized that ZL would yield AC, so that the two are equivalent (over the remaining axioms of set theory). Zorn regarded his principle less as a theorem than as an axiom—he hoped that it would supersede cumbersome applications in algebra of transfinite induction and well-ordering, which algebraists in the Noether school had come to regard as “transcendental” devices."

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A Timeline of Consistency and Independence Results}
%\large

The following results motivate treating AC as an independent axiom: %of set theory

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item[1922:] Fraenkel shows that AC is independent of a particular kind of set theory (set theory with atoms)
%atoms are not sets; rather they are objects that do not have any elements but are distinct from the empty set 
%see here: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ZFA
%``Zermelo's original 1908 axiomatisation of set theory included atoms, but they were soon discarded as a foundational approach as they could be modeled inside of atomless set theory.''
%proof idea: ``By allowing atoms in our models, we lend ourselves to the method of Fraenkel-Mostowski models, where we can obtain models in which the axiom of choice fails by imposing some symmetry on the atoms (so that we cannot uniformly pick an atom out of many).''



%1936: ``Lindenbaum and Mostowski extend and refine Fraenkel’s permutation method, and prove the independence of various statements of set theory weaker than AC . (Lindenbaum and Tarski 1938)"

\item[1938:] G\"odel shows that AC is consistent with ZF set theory
%``Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of AC with the axioms of set theory (see the entry on Kurt Gödel) rests on an entirely different idea: that of definability. He introduced a new hierarchy of sets—the constructible hierarchy—by analogy with the cumulative type hierarchy. "
% Specifically, Godel constructed something called the constructible universe of sets (which has a similar structure to how we defined the ordinal hierarchy). He showed that this structure is a model of ZF and also a model of AC (and also a model of the generalized continuum hypothesis) % so it follows that the axiom of choice is consistent with ZF set theory


\item[1950s:] Various people come close to showing AC is independent of ZF set theory
%``Mendelson, Shoenfield and Specker, working independently, use the permutation method to establish the independence of various forms of AC from a system of set theory without atoms, but also lacking the axiom of foundation (Mendelson 1956, 1958, Shoenfield 1955, Specker 1957)."

%``This argument shows that collections of sets of atoms need not necessarily have choice functions, but it fails to establish the same fact for the “usual” sets of mathematics, for example the set of real numbers. This had to wait until 1963 when Paul Cohen showed that it is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory (which preclude the existence of atoms) to assume that a countable collection of pairs of sets of real numbers fails to have a choice function. The core of Cohen’s method of proof—the celebrated method of forcing—was vastly more general than any previous technique; nevertheless his independence proof also made essential use of permutation and symmetry in essentially the form in which Fraenkel had originally employed them."

\item[1963:] Paul Cohen shows independence of AC from ZF set theory
%cohen showed that ``a countable collection of pairs of sets of real numbers [can] fails to have a choice function"
%seems like Cohen was at MIT for a year after his phD from UChicago:
%`` spent the academic year 1958–59 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before spending 1959–61 as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. These were years in which Cohen made a number of significant mathematical breakthroughs.''
%``For his result on the continuum hypothesis, Cohen won the Fields Medal in mathematics in 1966, and also the National Medal of Science in 1967.[11] The Fields Medal that Cohen won continues to be the only Fields Medal to be awarded for a work in mathematical logic, as of 2022.'' Latter is a fun fact haha! 
%seems like Cohen thought the continuum hypothesis obviously false; very interesting

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Every vector space has a basis (equivalent to AC---Blass 1984)
\item[] -- Important for physics!!! e.g. quantum mechanics

\item Tychonoff's theorem (1930): every product of compact topological spaces is compact (equivalent to AC---Kelley 1950)
%This was proved equivalent to AC in Kelley 1950. But for compact Hausdorff spaces it is equivalent to BPI (see below) and hence weaker than AC

\item Every commutative ring with identity has a maximal ideal (equivalent to AC---Hodges 1979)
%ideals are a generalization of special subsets of rings that are closed under addition and absorb multiplication, e.g. the even integers as a subset of the integers: adding two even numbers results in an even and multiplying an even by any other integer results in an even. 
%ideals are the kernels of ring homomorphisms, so can be used to define factor (i.e. quotient) rings 
%``A proper ideal I is called a maximal ideal if there exists no other proper ideal J with I a proper subset of J. The factor ring of a maximal ideal is a simple ring in general and is a field for commutative rings''

\item Downward L\"owenheim--Skolem: if a theory has a model of an infinite cardinality $\kappa$ then it has a model of any smaller infinite cardinality $\mu$ (including a countable model!)
% we might think that this consequence itself leads to some paradoxes, e.g. Skolem's `paradox' : we can prove in ZFC that there are uncountable sets. but so there are countable models (i.e. models whose domain of objects is countable) that say there are uncountable sets. and in these models, the thing that says `there is an uncoutnable set' will be countable.

We may be motivated to develop a more accurate, literal model of physical space where the BT theorem doesn't apply
% Maddy: ``wouldn't it be considerably more reasonable to conclude that physical regions are more effectively modeled by measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^3$"? 
% One specific proposal she considers: model physical space in what's called $L(\mathbb{R})$, where all of the sets of the reals are measurable. $L(\mathbb{R})$ is the smallest model of set theory that contains all of the real numbers: its existence requires the existence of a super compact cardinal.

% % Plausibly save this for the week we discuss AC and Banach Tarksi!!!

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Weaker Consequences of AC}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Some key results are consequences of AC but weaker than it \\ (i.e. AC entails them but not vice versa, in ZF)

\item \emph{Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem} (BPI): every Boolean algebra has a maximal (or prime) ideal

%``An ideal of the Boolean algebra A is a subset I such that for all x, y in I we have x ∨ y in I and for all a in A we have a ∧ x in I. This notion of ideal coincides with the notion of ring ideal in the Boolean ring A. An ideal I of A is called prime if I ≠ A and if a ∧ b in I always implies a in I or b in I" 
%``An ideal I of A is called maximal if I ≠ A and if the only ideal properly containing I is A itself. For an ideal I, if a ∉ I and −a ∉ I, then I ∪ a or I ∪ {−a} is properly contained in another ideal J. Hence, that an I is not maximal and therefore the notions of prime ideal and maximal ideal are equivalent in Boolean algebras"

%note that the dual of the Boolean Prime Ideal theorem is the Ultrafilter theorem: every filter can be extended to an ultrafilter. Filters are dual concepts to ideals. Ultrafilters are dual concepts to prime ideals. 

%``The dual of an ideal is a filter. A filter of the Boolean algebra A is a subset p such that for all x, y in p we have x ∧ y in p and for all a in A we have a ∨ x in p. The dual of a maximal (or prime) ideal in a Boolean algebra is ultrafilter." so filters are closed under multiplication (i.e. meet) and they absorb all elements under join (or). note that the ring addition is exclusive disjunction (double check this)

%Ultrafilter theorem: ``The statement every filter in a Boolean algebra can be extended to an ultrafilter is called the Ultrafilter Theorem and cannot be proven in ZF, if ZF is consistent. Within ZF, it is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. The Ultrafilter Theorem has many equivalent formulations: every Boolean algebra has an ultrafilter, every ideal in a Boolean algebra can be extended to a prime ideal, etc."

\item Compactness theorem for first-order logic: \\ if every finite subset of a set of first-order sentences has a model, then the set has a model (even if this set is infinite)

\item[] -- Epistemic modal claims represent an aspect of the world

\item[] -- e.g. describe the epistemic state of an agent
% helpful gloss from page 307: ``standardly the descriptivist's truth conditions are propositions about some body of evidence, where this body of evidence includes the knowledge of the agent doing the believing" [307]

\item G. E. Moore: $\langle$\textit{it's possible that I'm not getting promoted}$\rangle$ means `It is not certain that I am' or `I don't know that I am'. 
% Presumably a similar gloss would work for `I might not be getting promoted'
% (1873--1958)

% Other descriptivist contextualist account that could explore: hacking 1967, Teller 1972

\item \textit{Which} agents? \textit{Which} aspects of their evidential states?
%could give Keith DeRose's gloss, quoted by Yalcin on p. 298 on the nonfactualism paper
%one idea: just index possibility and other epistemic modals to the relevant agents. 

\item Stanley: $\langle$It is possible$_A$ that $p$$\rangle$ is true iff what $A$ knows does not---in a manner obvious to $A$---entail $\enot p$

% Helpful gloss from Sarah Moss 2013 phil review paper, citing Yalcin 2007: the sentence `it might be raining' ``is true just in case certain contextually determined evidence does not rule out that it is raining" [3]

\frametitle{Descriptivism about `Probably'}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Consider probability modals like `probably' and `it is likely that'

\item \emphz{Descriptivism}: these modals describe the speaker's epistemic state, e.g. their credences. 

\item To assert $\langle$It's probably sunny$\rangle$ means your credence in sunshine is greater than $0.5$ (or above some contextual threshold)
%where credences can be understood in terms of betting behavior
\item[] (credences can be understood in terms of dispositions to bet)
% e.g. Jeffrey quotation in Yalcin footnote 3: ``if you say the probability of rain is 70\% you are reporting that, all things considered, you would bet on rain at odds of $7:3$"

\item Alternative view: $\langle$It's probably sunny$\rangle$ means that relative to a particular probability measure $P$ and body of evidence, $P(\text{sunshine}) > \text{some contextually-determined threshold}$
% allegedly, a body of evidence can induce a probability measure
% the relevant body of evidence can be determined by the context, e.g. the context in which the sentence is uttered or assessed

 %relative to a particular probability measure, a relevant set of evidence

\frametitle{Expressivism about Epistemic Modals}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Guiding question: what state(s) of mind do we express when we believe or say that something \textit{might} be the case \\ (or that something \textit{probably} is the case)?

% % Note that here, I seemingly deviate from Yalcin nonfactualism chapter. The view that he considers, which he calls the `first-order model' (taken from Frank Veltman) seems still descriptivist to me. Or else it involves a seemingly primitive notion of possibility (e.g. possible worlds), which seems partly what's in question here.
% p. 309: On the allegedly non-descriptivist model that Yalcin discusses, ``to believe Bob might be in his office is simply to be in a doxastic state which fails to rule out the possibility that Bob is in his office". So we don't explicitly mention possible-bob-in-office worlds. 
% On page 312, Yalcin claims that he is still committed to a (robust) ontology of possibilities, e.g. possible worlds. Yet Thomasson describes how `possiblility' talk is a modal nominalization from `it is possible' talk. which is a modal adjectival form of `might' talk. 

\item \emph{Expressivism}: to judge that $\langle$it is possibly sunny$\rangle$ is to express an attitude of \textit{being for not ruling out that it is sunny}. 

\item[] -- It says something like ``Don't be certain that it's not sunny!"

%\item[] -- Or, ``don't take me to know that it's not sunny"! 

% Helpful gloss from Bennett 2003, p. 90 (cited by smoss 2013): the speaker ``is not assuring me that her value for a certain conditional probability is high, but is assuring me of that high-value. \dots She aims to convince me of that probability, not the proposition that it is her probability" [quoted on p. 4] 

\item Epistemic modals help us coordinate on which states of affairs to leave open, to consider as live options

% So expressivism about probability or credences might be something like the following: being for being this confident! Accepting a set of norms that recommend this degree of confidence (perhaps given a particular body of evidence)

\item If you answer `no,' then you are an \emphz{incompatibilist}: 

\item \textit{hard determinist}: you also believe that determinism is true
\item[] -- so you deny we have the relevant kind of free will

\item \textit{libertarian} (about free will): you also deny determinism
\item[] -- so you believe we do have free will (modulo worries about compatibility with indeterminism!)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

%\item free will has one necessary and sufficient condition: 

\item (Classical) \emph{Compatibilism}: you acted freely if and only if you met the following condition: 

\item \textbf{Weak Principle of Alternative Possibilities}: if you had wanted to choose otherwise than you did, then nothing would have prevented you from choosing otherwise.
%Frankfurt cases provide a counterexample to the necessity of this condition. still seems sufficient though. 

\item Notice that meeting this condition entails that another claim holds: you have the power or ability to make a choice in the sense that nothing constrains you or prevents you from making that choice

\item According to compatibilism, a sufficient condition for LACKING free will in a given circumstance is that you are constrained, coerced, or otherwise manipulated


%\item Hence, if anything does constrain you or prevent you from making that choice, then you don’t have this power or ability to do what you want to do, and hence you could not have chosen otherwise.

%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Imagine that you don't think free will is necessary for moral responsibility: e.g. an agent can be morally responsible for their actions even if they did not act freely 
\item[] -- roughly, you think it would still be appropriate to praise or blame this agent for their action

\item You might then ask a similar `compatibility question' about whether moral responsibility is compatible with determinism

\item e.g. perhaps \textit{surface free will} suffices for moral responsibility 

\item When it comes to social and political decisions, you might think that moral responsibility is really what matters

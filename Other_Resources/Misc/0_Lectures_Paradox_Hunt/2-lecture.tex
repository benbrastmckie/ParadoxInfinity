\item For no other reason than because we can (allegedly), our goal is to construct sets of larger and larger cardinality

\item To do so, we rely on a distinct kind of `number' known as \textit{ordinals}

\item As the name suggests, ordinals arise from the study of orderings

\item Just as cardinalities represent isomorphisms for the purposes of counting, ordinals represent isomorphisms for the purposes of ordering elements in a series. 

\item Of course, these mega-large numbers are interesting perhaps insofar as we have reason to believe they exist, so we'll take some excursions into the ontological status of numbers

%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Strict Ordering}: a relation $<$ constitutes a strict ordering on a set $S$ just in case it satisfies the following two conditions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item[] For any a, b, and c in $S$, we have

\item \textbf{Asymmetry}: If $a < b$, then it is not the case that $b < a$

\item \textbf{Transitivity}: If $a < b $ and $b < c$, then $a < c$

\end{enumerate}

\bigskip 

\item Note that asymmetry entails irreflexivity: $\forall a \in S$, $\enot (a < a)$

\item Concept of `strict ordering' captures our intuitive notion of precedence, i.e. of what it is for one thing to precede another
% you might even think that these conditions are constitutive of the meaning of precedence

\item \textbf{Totality}: $\forall a, b \in S$ such that $a \neq b$, either $a < b$ or $b < a$ \\ (and by asymmetry, this is an exclusive-or for strict orderings)

\frametitle{``How would you like that?" Well-ordered plz}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item A \emph{well-ordering} is a strict total ordering such that: 

\item Every non-empty subset has a smallest member according to the ordering

\item[] -- i.e. $\forall$ non-empty subsets $S$, $\exists$ some $s \in S$ such that $s < y$ for every other $y \in S, y \neq s$

% Note that if the set was not strictly ordered, we could have ties, i.e. two elements that are the `smallest'. And presumably that would mess some stuff up?

% Question: does a well-ordering have to be strict?
%This fact seems to indicate yes: ``Every element s of a well-ordered set, except a possible greatest element, has a unique successor (next element), namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than s. " So this seems to rule out a tree structure. 

\item To show a set is not a well-ordering, it suffices to:

\item[1.)] show it is not a strict total order or

\item[2.)] show that there exists a subset that does not have a unique smallest member according to the ordering

% % I guess a nice little homework problem would have been the following: show that the smallest member in a subset of a well-ordered set is unique. Proof: by definition, the smallest member is less than every other member in the subset. By asymmetry, this means that no other member is less than this smallest member. so no other member can be the smallest member. 

%interesting feature which is not intuitive to me: ``There may be elements besides the least element which have no predecessor"
%example: \omega + \omega (e.g. by doing the evens, then doing the odds). In this case, neither 0 nor 1 have predecessors!

Which of the following sets are strictly totally ordered by the defined relation `$<$'? If not, provide a concrete counterexample! \\

Remember to check: (i) asymmetry, (ii) transitivity, and (iii) totality

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]

\item The set of natural numbers, where $1 < 2 <3 < \dots < 0$?
% % Clearly transitive, clearly asymmetric, and clearly total.

\item The set of rationals, where $a < b$ iff $b = a + q$ for some $q \in \mathbb{Q}^{>0}$
% yes, note that for any two distinct arbitrary rational numbers, one of them is at least $q$-greater than the other. Note that if we allow $q=0$, then we would not have a strict ordering because every rational would then relate to itself! so we'd have reflexivity

\item Same as above but we allow $q=0$? 

\item The set $\mathcal{P}(\{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \})$, where $a < b$ iff $a \subsetneq b$
% note that to solve this problem, you don't actually need to explicitly write down the 16 members in the power set. It suffices to notice that $\{ 0 \}$ and $\{1 \}$ are both in the power set, but neither is a proper subset of the other, so neither $0 < 1 $ nor $1 < 0$, so this is not a TOTAL order. 

\item The set of Olympic athletes, where $a < b $ iff $a$ has won fewer medals than $b$
% no: there exist Olympic athletes who have won the same number of medals, in which case neither precedes the other. Technically, I should provide a concrete counterexample. 
%both Ryan Lochte and Natalie Coughlin have won 12 medals in US swimming. 

\item The set of people on Earth, where $a < b$ iff $a$'s birth-year precede's $b$'s birth-year
% not a total order because some people were born in the same year

% I'm drawing heavily on Shapiro's discussion in chapter 6 (logicism) of thinking about mathematics. Probably some better discussions of this stuff.

% % Interesting that part of Frege's motivation was to define the cardinal numbers independently of the ordinal numbers. Whereas Cantor had used the ordinal numbers to define the cardinal numbers. I should probably look into the history of what Cantor was doing, since it might help motivate studying the ordinals. Maybe this is related to using the ordinals as blueprints to define sets of higher cardinality.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Hume's Principle}: for any concepts $F, G,$ the number of $F $ is identical to the number of $G $ if and only if $F$ and $G$ are equinumerous
% idea described on page 134 of Shapiro: the left hand side of the HP has a grammatical form involving objects. The right hand side supplies truth conditions, which we then use to show the existence of these objects.

\item `equinumerous' means ``same cardinality," i.e. there exists a bijection between the objects that fall under each concept 

\item Obviously, to use HP to \textit{define} numbers, we have to define `equinumerous' in a way that doesn't refer to numbers

\item Frege showed how to do this using (2nd-order) logic alone

\item Define the number zero to be \textit{the number of the concept} \\ \textsc{not identical to itself}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item A natural question: how do we know that zero is unique?
% Indeed, Chloe asked this question on Thursday 2/22, 2023

\item For instance, in group theory, one proves that the identity element is unique. Assume that another identity element exists, and show that it must equal the first:
% 0 + 0' = 0  and 0+0' = 0', since both are units. So 0 = 0' 

\item In arithmetic, we seemingly need to prove that there is a unique initial object. 

%seemingly I could explain this by using Peano arithmetic axioms!
%see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gBoP8jZ1Is
%key claim: the zero is never a successor of any other number! and we definte successor function as injective. 

%proof: assume there are two zeros 0 and 0'. then by injectivity of S, if S(0) = S(0') entails that 0 = 0'. worry: what is to prevent there as well from being two different 1's? e.g. s.t. S(0) = 1 whereas S(0') = 1' and 1 \neq 1'? 
%does axiom of induction somehow prevent this kind of non-standard model? 

%definition of natural numbers from peano arithmetic: the minimal, non-empty set that admits a successor function, where this function satisfies peano's five axioms. 
%note that addition and multiplication be defined using the successor function. 

%\item Does the following work: Assume for the sake of argument that there is another initial object 0'. Then its successor is also 1 (since we are recovering arithmetic, which has the well-ordering property). So then $0' = 0$

%As Quine said, ``No entity without identity''; quoted by shapiro (p. 112) neat how my indispensability paper basically shares this intuition, which I recall Alan Baker trying to reject in conversation. 

\item A Platonist ought to be able to tell us whether or not the number $4$ is distinct from Julius Caesar

\item e.g., with Hume's principle alone, Frege's conception of number does not determine whether the following statement is true or false: `$ 4 = $ Julius Caesar'

\item As far as HP is concerned, the number of the concept ``\textsc{identical to 0 or 1 or 2 or 3}'' might just be Julius Caesar
% recall on the further account that Frege gives, the number 4 equals the set of all concepts whose extensions are of cardinality 4, i.e. the concepts whose extensions are equinumerous with the  the number of the concept \textsc{identical to 0 or 1 or 2 or 3}
% so Frege's further account, in terms of extensions, arguably meets this burden. For some reason, there are issues with the approach through extensions. Probably need to review Shapiro chapter 6, section 1 on this. I recall that the neo-logicist drop the route through extensions.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Initial Ordinals}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textbf{Initial ordinal}: an ordinal that precedes all other ordinals of the same cardinality.

\item e.g. $\omega$ is the first ordinal of cardinality $|\mathbb{N}|$, which we call $\beth_{0'}$ or $\beth_{1}$

\item An initial ordinal $\kappa$ can be used as proxy or representative for its own cardinality, so these ordinals are at least some of the ``cardinals''

\item If the generalized continuum hypothesis is true, then every cardinality corresponds to the cardinality of some initial ordinal 

%: $\kappa = |\kappa|$.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Beth Hierarchy}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item $\beth_\alpha \text{ (read ``beth-alpha'') is the initial ordinal of cardinality } |\mathfrak{B}_\alpha|$.

\item  So, abusing notation and letting `$\beth_\alpha$' now denote a cardinal, we can write ``$\beth_\alpha = |\mathfrak{B}_\alpha|$''
%following is misleading unless you explain we're abusing notation: So: $\beth_\alpha =  |\mathfrak{B}_\alpha|$.
%seemingly rare instance of mathematicians or logicians abusing notation, something physicists do all the time! 

\item $\beth_0 = |\mathbb{N}|$ and $\beth_{0'} = |\powerset(\mathbb{N})|$ (so $\beth_{0'}$ is an \textbf{uncountable} ordinal, i.e. an ordinal whose cardinality is uncountable). 

\item Since the beths are \emph{ordinals}, they can be used to define sets bigger than anything we've considered so far. For instance: 

\item $\mathfrak{B}_{\beth_{0'}}$ (where viewed as a cardinal, $\beth_{0'} = |\powerset(\mathbb{N})|$)

\item $\mathfrak{B}_{\beth_{\beth_\omega}}$ (where as a cardinal, $\beth_{\beth_\omega} = |\mathfrak{B}_{\beth_{\omega}}|$)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Let $\mathscr{U} = \bigcup \set{\powerset^m(\mathbb{N}): m \in \mathbb{N}}$

\item Does  $\mathscr{U}$ contain the set $\underbrace{\{\{\ldots\{\{}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}118\underbrace{\}\}\ldots\}\}}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}$ for each $n>0$? 

%\answer{Let $n$ be an arbitrary natural number greater than 0. Then $\mathcal{P}^n(\mathbb{N})$ contains the set $\underbrace{\{\{\ldots\{\{}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}118\underbrace{\}\}\ldots\}\}}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}$. Since $\mathscr{U}$ contains every member of $\mathcal{P}^n(\mathbb{N})$, $\mathscr{U}$ must also contain  $\underbrace{\{\{\ldots\{\{}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}118\underbrace{\}\}\ldots\}\}}_{\mbox{\scriptsize $n$ times}}$.}

%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Notation: distinguish phi-symbol `$\phi$' from the empty set `$\emptyset$'

\item Is $\powerset(\emptyset)$ well-ordered by $\in$?
%yes it is, trivially! 

\item Is $\powerset(\mathbb{Q})$  well-ordered by $\subseteq$?
% No, it is not even a total ordering. Note that $\powerset(\mathbb{Q})$ contains $\{ 5 \}$ and $\{ 1/2 \}$, but neither is a subset of the other.

\item What is $\powerset^3(\emptyset) := \powerset (\powerset (\powerset (\emptyset))) $?

\frametitle{Addition PLUS Multiplication???}
%\large
%both true 

\begin{enumerate}[<+->]

\item Is \((\omega \times 0'') + \omega <_o (\omega \times \omega) + 0''\)?
%True. \((\omega \times 0'') + \omega = ((\omega + \omega) + \omega)\), which is much smaller than \(\omega \times \omega\) (and therefore much smaller than \((\omega \times \omega) + 0''\).)

\item Does \(\omega \times (\omega + \omega) = (\omega \times \omega) + (\omega \times \omega)\)?
%True. \(\omega \times (\omega + \omega)\) is the result of using \((\omega + \omega)\) as a template, and filling each position with an \(\omega\)-sequence. So we get an \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences followed by an \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences. 
%Right hand side: \((\omega \times \omega) + (\omega \times \omega)\) is the result of starting with a sequence of type \((\omega \times \omega)\) (i.e. an \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences), and appending another sequence of type \((\omega \times \omega)\) (i.e. another \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences) to the right. So, again, we get an \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences followed by an \(\omega\)-sequence of \(\omega\)-sequences



%%practice with formal definiton of addition; could include if time:
%\item  \question{\(\alpha + 0' = \alpha \cup \{\alpha\}\) ($\alpha$ an ordinal)}

%\answer{True. It follows from the Construction Principle that \(\alpha \cup \{\alpha\} = \alpha'\), and it follows from the definition of addition that  \(\alpha + 0' = (\alpha + 0)' = \alpha'\). Putting the two together, \(\alpha \cup \{\alpha\} = \alpha'\) .}

\frametitle{The Continuum Hypothesis}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Continuum Hypothesis}: There is no set $A$ such that \(\beth_0 < |A| < \beth_1\), where these beths denote cardinals, e.g. $\beth_1 = |\beth_1| = |\omega|$.

\item i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is between $|\mathbb{N}|$ and the cardinality of the `continuum', i.e. $|\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})| = |\mathbb{R}|$

\item \emphz{Generalized CH}: There is no set \(A\) such that \(\beth_\alpha < |A| < \beth_{\alpha + 1}\).

\item If true, then every cardinality corresponds to the cardinality of some initial ordinal in the Beth hierarchy of initial ordinals.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Burali--Forti `Paradox'}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item We keep talking about the ordinals, but we can prove that there cannot exist a set of all ordinal numbers

\item In general, there can be no such thing as the set of all sets. Such a set would have to be a member of itself, and hence fail to contain every set.
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Infinite

\item Of course, `set' is a technical term, so this isn't a paradox in the strict logical sense

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The BF `Paradox'}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Suppose, for \textit{reductio}, that $\Omega$ is the set of all ordinals.

\item Since $\Omega$ consists of every ordinal, it consists of every ordinal that's been introduced so far. But a new ordinal is just the set of every ordinal that's been introduced so far. So: \textbf{$\Omega$  is an ordinal}.

\item If $\Omega$ was itself an ordinal, it would be a member of itself (and therefore have itself as a predecessor). \\ But no ordinal can be its own predecessor (by irreflexivity). 
\item[] -- So: \textbf{$\Omega$  is not an ordinal} (contradicting prior bolded claim).

\item Hence, there is no set of all ordinals!

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item One way to avoid `paradox': declare it impermissible to form a set from an arbitrary property (reject ``unrestricted comprehension")

\item Axiom of separation/comprehension: it is permissible to form a set of objects that have a given property provided that they belong to a given set. 

\item i.e. any definable subclass of a set is itself a set

\frametitle{Some Worries about this Resolution}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item But if a class of individuals exists, why can't we in general form a \textit{set}??? If there is no set, might we worry that some of the individuals in fact do not exist?

\item Does it start to feel like we are playing a game rather than surveying Platonic space?

\item Alternatively, given that our meta-language contains predicates that refer to classes that are not sets within our theory, might we worry that our theory is \textit{missing something}?

% Our metalanguage contains predicates that do not refer to any sets within the theory

\subsection{\phantom{v} Connections to the Axiom of Choice}

% % Plausibly save this for the week we discuss AoC and Banach Tarksi!!!

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Well-Ordering Theorem}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Well-ordering theorem} (Zermelo's theorem): every set can be well-ordered, i.e. equipped with a strict total order such that every non-empty subset has a smallest element

\item Perhaps surprisingly, this theorem is logically equivalent to the Axiom of Choice (AoC) \\ (in first-order logic; in 2nd-order logic the AoC is weaker)
\item[] (indeed, Zermelo originally used the AoC to prove this theorem, taking the AoC to be `obvious.')

\item Can you conceptualize or visualize a well-ordering of $\mathbb{R}$? 

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Another Logically Equivalent Theorem}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Both the well-ordering theorem and the Axiom of Choice are logically equivalent to Zorn's lemma

\item \emph{Zorn's lemma}: given a partially ordered set that has upper bounds for every totally-ordered subset, there is necessarily at least one maximal element (i.e. an element that is not smaller than any other element)

\item Used to show a number of key results in 20th century math: \\ -- every vector space has a basis; \\  every product of compact spaces is compact (Tychonoff); \\ Hahn--Banach theorem in functional analysis (can extend bounded linear functionals from a subspace to the whole space), etc. 

\item So rejecting AoC comes at great cost! 

%\item Utility of Zorn's lemma: rather than undertake a new transfinite induction, you can check the conditions of Zorn's lemma! 

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Clarifying the Equivalence}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item These three claims (Axiom of Choice, well-ordering theorem, and Zorn's lemma) are logically equivalent in the following sense:

\item Working within Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory, given one of these claims, you can prove the other two.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Axiom of Dependent Choice (DC)}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item This is a weakening of the Axiom of Choice that suffices to recover most of real analysis

%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_dependent_choice

\item In ZF, one cannot prove the existence of a non-measurable set of real numbers using only DC

%possible excursion topics:
%bernadette's paradox, which i find puzzling, and relate briefly to causal explN; seems to me like Rayo and Yablo disagree about proper interpretation of this paradox! 
%causal explN background: e.g. woodward view (could be relevant for time-travel stuff, so could also save for later)
%rationality: straightforwardly factual vs. normative/plan-laden; defs relevant for decision theory unit!
%stuff on axiom of choice: relevant for bacon's puzzle
%could also save bacon puzzle for AoC unit! or return to later 
%could couple w/ Yablo's extension case, where the strategy to Bacon's paradox seems to lead to a genuine contradiction!!! see my notes in 3-thoughts and also the slides he sent me. Bevs vs. Owls 

% %Note to Josh if using these slides in a philsci class: I have some additional slides on phenomenology of eternalism, based on Spinrad's the weed of time short sci-fi story. could be fun to talk about in a longer unit on philosophy of time. see slides week 6 of my PHIL 154 sci-fi class! 


% They could incorporate/do if needing to kill time:
% chalk and talk the review sheet for this week
% talk about the strangeness of reductio proofs (could do this in future as well!); but defs relevant this week given large number of reductio proofs on the pset 
%changes to notion of rigor in mathematics; e.g. bolzano moving away from physical intuition , motion, passage of time.

\subsection{Determinism}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Determinism!}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textbf{Deterministic evolution}: given (i) the laws and (ii) complete information about a state (e.g. initial and boundary conditions), all \textit{future} states are uniquely determined 

\item \textit{Reversibility}: given (i) and (ii), all \textit{past} states are determined  

\item \emph{Determinism}: the universe evolves deterministically 
% Or more modestly: everything within your light cone, since that's all that matters for you. modulo entanglement

% Of course, if the laws are time reversible, then determinism entails reversibility. 

\item \emphz{Indeterminism}: the past does not determine the future 

\item Note well: determinism entails that the future is fixed/settled, but the claim that $\langle$the future is settled$\rangle$ does NOT entail determinism

\item For instance, eternalism does not entail determinism. 
\item[] -- The future could be settled without the future being determined by past events plus laws.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Determinism is NOT \emphz{Fatalism}!}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item CRUCIAL: distinguish determinism from \emphz{fatalism}: whatever happens in the future is going to happen \textit{no matter what we do}

\item e.g. fatalism about climate catastrophe: \\ no matter what we do, the ice-caps will melt soon 
%we are doomed
%e.g., a fatalist about climate change would say that no matter how much we try to prevent/slowdown climate change, its disastrous effects are inevitable

\item[] -- Fatalism goes beyond determinism

\item It may be deterministically the case right now that we are doomed, but not that we're doomed no matter what we do. 

\item If fatalism is false, our actions, decisions, choices etc. still make a difference to the way the world is (even if we could not have chosen otherwise, e.g. because determinism is true)

% % Another example, which comes up on the problem set: it may be determined that you are going to do well on your exam. But it might still be the case that if you don't study, then you will fail. It's just also determinant that you are going to study.

\subsection{Time Travel}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Two notions of `time'}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{External time}: how much time has passed according to the world external to the time traveler (e.g. how much time has passed on earth)

\item \emphz{Personal time}: how much time has passed according to the time traveler.
\item[] -- How much time they experience passing (e.g. the duration of their trip)
\item[] -- How much time has passed according to their personal watch/clock
\item[] -- Or according to their biological processes, e.g. hair growth, digestion
%\item[] -- Also called “proper time”
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is time travel anyway?}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Lewis: \textbf{time travel} occurs whenever there is a discrepancy between someone’s personal time and external time
%so twin's paradox involves time travel! 

\item Time-slide to the future: less personal time has passed than external time 
\item[] -- e.g., moving through a whole century in five minutes

\item Time-slide to the past: personal time has passed, but the external time is earlier
\item[] -- e.g., rewinding a whole century in five minutes

\frametitle{Changing the Past (or future)?}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item If we can time travel, can we change the past (or future)?

\item Assuming that eternalism is true, then no!
\item The past and future are fixed: the events there are settled, once and for all
\item Whatever happened in the past happened; you can’t change that
\item[] -- What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas (in the past!)

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Logical Impossibility of Changing the Past}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Even if eternalism is false, changing the past involves a contradiction

\item Changing the past therefore seems logically impossible!

\item Argument: Grandfather's paradox (or more mundane cases)

\item e.g. it can't be both true that you drank exactly five glasses of water yesterday and true that you drank exactly eight glasses of water yesterday

\item if something is logically impossible, then it must be physically impossible as well

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Affecting the Past}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item If we can time travel, can we \textit{affect} the past?

\item Yes! (in the sense that you could perform actions in the past)

\item Even if your actions are set in timeless stone, your actions still causally matter 
\item[] -- They still make a difference to the way the world is.
%\item Connection with compatibilism: even if all your future actions are determined, your future actions still affect the future (even if you can’t change them)
\item The impossibility of changing the past does not entail that you necessarily made no difference to the past. 
\item[] -- You might have time traveled and saved the world! 
%interesting wrinkle: if you have time-traveled to the past and done something important, you might not know that now. you might only find out later!

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Affecting vs. Changing the Past}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Lewis (p. 5): you can make the past (or future) different from what it \textit{would have been otherwise} without the action you performed

\item[] -- Notice that this subjunctive conditional does NOT entail that you could have acted otherwise

\item[] -- This is not changing the past (or future): it is affecting it

\item This notion of affecting (but not changing) the past is closely connected to a notion of free will that is compatible with determinism
%if you had wanted to, you could have acted differently

\frametitle{Two Notions of Capacity or Freedom}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item In what sense, if any, can you kill your grandfather in an external time before you were born?

\item Lewis: two different notions of “can”. Don’t equivocate b/w them!

\item Can$_{capacity/skill}$: having the skill or ability it takes to do something
\item[] -- Lewis: by training with a rifle, etc. you could gain the capacity
\item[] -- You could have what it takes (mentally, physically, etc.)
%o	In this sense, you couldskill kill your past self

\item Can$_{logic}$: ability to do something without it resulting in a logical contradiction
\item[] -- No matter what, you know that you must fail in killing your gF
\item[] -- For you know that you lived to travel back in time
\item[] -- And it can’t be both true and false that you were born
\item[] -- So you logically can’t kill your grandfather
\item[] -- But failing does not entail that you couldn’t$_{capacity/skill}$ do it

%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Imagine that you time travel to 1940 and that you can$_{capacity}$ kill your grandfather.

\item[1.] Is there a satisfying explanation as to why you fail? 

\item[] -- What, if anything, is dissatisfying about a detailed causal-mechanical story of what happens? 

\item[2.] Now imagine that we ALL can$_{capacity}$ do this. Is there a satisfying explanation for the following fact: \\ $\langle$Everyone in 24.118 fails to kill their grandfathers$\rangle$

%e.g. is it satisfying to explain a conjunction of events by conjoining individual causal-mechanical explNs. is there a unified explN?

\item[] -- But now, C causes A (reverse causation); thanks to time travel
\item If this were true, then causes would not always precede their effects

\item Using the Time Machine, you travel back in time and talk to your 20-year-old self. 
\item[] -- You tell them how to build a time machine (C → A)

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lewis on Causal Loops}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Every event in this sequence has a cause and therefore an explanation
\item But the entire causal loop itself does not have an explanation
\item There is ``simply no answer'' to the question of where the relevant knowledge or information came from, or even why any of this took place (page 4).
\item So we can explain the individual parts, even as we cannot explain the whole loop itself!

%\large

\begin{itemize}%[<+->]

\item Is the difficulty or absence of time-travel a problem for eternalism?
\item Recall that eternalism puts time on the same footing as space
\item We have a really easy time moving around space (provided we don’t bump into things)
\item Why do we have such a hard time moving around time?! %is there `something we're always bumping into temporally???'
\item It appears as though we are condemned to only move into the future, never into the past
\item But if the past and future are really on the same ontological footing, why do we only ever move into the future?
\item Likewise, if the passage of time is really an illusion, why can’t we visit the past?
%•	One eternalist response: time travel is possible. It’s just really hard! Thus really rare!

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

%\item free will has one necessary and sufficient condition: 

\item (Classical) \emph{Compatibilism}: you acted freely if and only if you met the following condition: 

\item \textbf{Weak Principle of Alternative Possibilities}: if you had wanted to choose otherwise than you did, then nothing would have prevented you from choosing otherwise.
%Frankfurt cases provide a counterexample to the necessity of this condition. still seems sufficient though. 

\item Notice that meeting this condition entails that another claim holds: you have the power or ability to make a choice in the sense that nothing constrains you or prevents you from making that choice

\item According to compatibilism, a sufficient condition for LACKING free will in a given circumstance is that you are constrained, coerced, or otherwise manipulated


%\item Hence, if anything does constrain you or prevent you from making that choice, then you don’t have this power or ability to do what you want to do, and hence you could not have chosen otherwise.

\frametitle{Compatibility with Moral Responsibility}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Imagine that you don't think free will is necessary for moral responsibility: e.g. an agent can be morally responsible for their actions even if they did not act freely 
\item[] -- roughly, you think it would still be appropriate to praise or blame this agent for their action

\item You might then ask a similar `compatibility question' about whether moral responsibility is compatible with determinism

\item e.g. perhaps \textit{surface free will} suffices for moral responsibility 

\item When it comes to social and political decisions, you might think that moral responsibility is really what matters

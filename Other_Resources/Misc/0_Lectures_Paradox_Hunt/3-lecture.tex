%possible excursion topics:
%bernadette's paradox, which i find puzzling, and relate briefly to causal explN; seems to me like Rayo and Yablo disagree about proper interpretation of this paradox! 
%causal explN background: e.g. woodward view (could be relevant for time-travel stuff, so could also save for later)
%rationality: straightforwardly factual vs. normative/plan-laden; defs relevant for decision theory unit!
%stuff on axiom of choice: relevant for bacon's puzzle
%could also save bacon puzzle for AoC unit! or return to later 
%could couple w/ Yablo's extension case, where the strategy to Bacon's paradox seems to lead to a genuine contradiction!!! see my notes in 3-thoughts and also the slides he sent me. Bevs vs. Owls 


% They could incorporate/do if needing to kill time:
% chalk and talk the review sheet for this week
% talk about the strangeness of reductio proofs (could do this in future as well!); but defs relevant this week given large number of reductio proofs on the pset 
%changes to notion of rigor in mathematics; e.g. bolzano moving away from physical intuition , motion, passage of time.

\item[(k)] \(S_k\) is true $\leftrightarrow$ \(S_n\)  is false (\(n>k\)).
\item[(k+1)] \(S_{k+1}\) is true $\leftrightarrow$ \(S_n\)  is false (\(n>k+1\)).

\item Consider an arbitrary sentence \(S_k\). Suppose it is true:

\item Then by condition (k), $S_n$ is false for all $n> k$. \\ So then $S_{k+1}$ and all $S_n$ for $n > k+1$ are false. 
\item[] But then statement $S_{k+1}$ must actually be true by condition (k+1). Contradiction

\item By the preceding argument, $S_m$ is false for each arbitrary $m$. Picking a $k$, this shows that $S_m$ is false for each $m>k$. 
\item[] But then by (k), $S_k$ is true. Contradiction. 
%So suppose that for arbitrary $k$, sentence $S_k$ is false. Since $k$ is arbitrary,  $S_m$ is false for every $m> k$

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Two intertranslatable paradoxes; can we give same response(s)?

\item Perhaps less clear why/whether the set of Yablo sentences \\ ``(0), (1), \dots, (k), \dots" is logically impossible

%\item Easier to see that a set of bombs might be logically impossible to program bombs in a certain way. 

\item Whereas we concluded we couldn't program the bombs (something would stop us), what do we conclude here?

\item An infinite being could clearly write down all the Yablo sentences, \textit{qua} marks on a page

\item So in what sense do these sentences `fail to exist'? 

%We can clearly write them all down, but they are not jointly satisfiable

\item \textit{Possible answer}: In a consistent bivalent logic, there is no model that assigns them all truth-values. \\ In that sense, the set is logically impossible: not meaningful
% So perhaps misleading to just say that there is no model that makes them all true 

\item Models exist that assign truth-values to an arbitrarily large finite number of Yablo sentences, but not all of them. 

% % So perhaps I don't find Yablo's puzzle really any more puzzling than the bomber paradox.

% % See bottom of page 76 four Rayo interpretation/response to Yablo's paradox. He modifies his semantic localist response to the liar paradox. Perhaps this is subtly different in some ways from what I have said above. He is arguing that the Yablo sentences must remain uninterpreted: neither true nor false). tried to fix my response above to accommodate this.

\item Three prisoners: Each of them is assigned a red or blue hat, based on the outcome of a coin toss.
\item Each of them can see the colors of the others' hats but has no idea about the color of his own hat.
\item The prisoners are taken into separate cells and asked about the color of their hat. They can offer an answer or remain silent. 
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item If all three prisoners remain silent, all three will remain captive %be killed.
\item If one of them answers incorrectly, all three will remain captive %be killed.
\item If at least one prisoner offers an answer, and everyone who offers an answer answers correctly, then all three prisoners will be freed.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
\item \emph{Puzzle}: Find a strategy that the prisoners could agree upon ahead of time that would guarantee that their chance of survival is above 50\%.

\item Have each prisoner follow these instructions:

\item[b)] If the other two prisoners have different color hats, remain silent

\item Result: 75\% chance of being freed! 

\item Remains the case that each prisoner individually has only a 50\% chance of answering correctly (out of eight possibilities, they remain silent in four, answer correctly in two, \& incorrectly in two)

\item \emph{Moral}: by coordinating on a strategy, a group can improve the chance of collective success without changing chance of individual success

\item Each person is assigned a red or blue hat, based on the outcome of tossing a fair coin. 

\item Everyone can see the hats of the people in front of her, but cannot see her own hat (or the hat of anyone behind her). 

\item At a set time, everyone has to guess the color of their own hat by crying out ``Red!" or ``Blue!".

\item People who correctly call out the color of their own hats will be freed. Everyone else will remain captive.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Use the Axiom of Choice (duh!)

\item Partition the set of all $\omega$-sequences of $0$s and $1$s

\item Two sequences belong to the same equivalence class provided they disagree at only finitely-many positions

\item For each equivalence class, the prisoners agree on a representative from that equivalence class (using AoC)

\item Each prisoner can determine which equivalence class the line belongs to (since they see infinitely-many hats in front of them and only finitely-many hats are behind)

\item \textit{Strategy}: answer assuming that the actual sequence is described by the chosen representative

\item The prisoners are guaranteed to be wrong only about finitely-many positions

\item What is happening? Individually, each prisoner has at best a 50\% chance of guessing their hat-color correctly

\item Somehow, following this strategy \textit{guarantees} that only finitely-many prisoners remain captive

\item What is the probability that any individual who follows this strategy correctly calls out their hat color?
% See page 84. Rayo argues that this probability is not defined. Might need to look into stuff on non-measurable sets coming from axiom of choice

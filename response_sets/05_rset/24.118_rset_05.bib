  abstract =      {According to David Lewis, the prisoner's dilemma (PD)
                   and Newcomb's problem (NP) are really just one
                   dilemma in two different forms (Lewis 1979). Lewis's
                   argument for this conclusion is ingenious and has
                   been widely accepted. However, it is flawed. As this
                   paper shows, the considerations that Lewis brings to
                   bear to show that the game he starts with is an NP
                   equally show that the game is not a PD.},

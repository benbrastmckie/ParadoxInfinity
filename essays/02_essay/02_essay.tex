\vspace{.2in}


Write an essay in response to the following statement:

\bigskip

\fbox{\parbox{150mm}{
  \center
  \texttt{(C)}~~ There cannot be time without change.
  \center
}}

\bigskip

Your essay will benefit from engaging with the following: 

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
  \question{
    \item Discuss how each of the terms in \texttt{(C)} is to be understood.
      You are welcome to reformulate the statement while being careful to preserve its spirit.
    \item Present the best arguments in support of accepting \texttt{(C)} as well as the best arguments for rejecting the \texttt{(C)}.
      These arguments do not need to be original, but be sure to state them in your own words, citing your sources.
    \item Critically evaluate the arguments for and against accepting \texttt{(C)}, raising any relevant objections to these arguments.
    \item Comment on which of the arguments you take to be the most convincing and why, evaluating the implications of the conclusion of this argument.
  }
  \answer{
  \item[\tt (A)] 
    answer
  }

\end{enumerate}
